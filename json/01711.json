real partnership not a coalition of the willing but the ability to engage lots of different","65":"but the ability to engage lots of different actors in networks and Partnerships that address

very good work actually on on the large Security Council Jim fearon and at Stanford has done work that shows by Game Theory if you enlarge the security Council the way the high-level panel recommended it is actually no worse and in some cases it's better because you you it's easier to isolate the existing video players not clear I'm not suggesting enlarging the security Council with more vetoes that we would not have any more vetoes","82":"and against so I think there are there is more can you think for a broader Security Council but the second answer and it has to be both is you go for the security Council but you also create other decision locking mechanism some more informal and some Regional that would also have legitimacy know we've done this we've gone to Nato that doesn't have a lot of legitimacy in what many parts of the world but it's still a better check on decisions than unilateral decision if you look at the way we're strengthening the the","7":"wonderful address thank

the religion we haven't done that and","75":"and the assembly as well so I'm concerned about when you you great you get the gray architecture up there which I think will be hard to do but let's assume you get it if it doesn't produce good results USA Americans are not patient people that I'm going to wait 5 years of some of these issues and and the net result will be at Jimmy Carter will be thrown out on the Ronald Reagan get elected","3":"out of some bernosky and I thank you very much for wonderful address thank you much too much","61":"the first question which is a comment on nuclear proliferation I would I agree with you about the difficulties and I must say I was very disappointed the Tony Blair didn't take chance of real leadership when he could have taken the chance to say you know we're not going to develop another generation of nuclear weapons were actually going to turn around it as a glue the leader it would have been an extraordinary opportunity and he didn't and he didn't for the reason you said the only hope I think is","79":"is that you I think there are arguments the first argument is yes it's going to be terrible but look at the old it's not working now and it's not working it's not working now because we often get blocked but it's also not working because the UN is increasingly illegitimate in many parts of the world so he when it does make a decision it's seen as a vehicle for American power so you have to start with the proposition that the system really is broken and now we're looking at other alternatives","38":"every in the world we need to return to the idea that there multiple face and no one faith gets to put it stamp on our foreign policy or I domestic policy I might take one in the back and then I'll go to Bob cuz yes hi my

more vetoes and it becomes easy to isolate the holdouts I would even say that I think we are moving toward a world in which won veto may not be enough I think of only France had to be towed invasion of Iraq the situation would have been very different than it was when you had multiple vetoes and votes against so I think there are there is","16":"to some fairly mythical image of us as Global leader the one we were Global leader there another superpower leaving another block of countries forget that that's not part of the agenda to the extent we make any difference I absolutely we agree the United States has to start by returning to Liberty at Liberty under log home and we are a long way from it right we first thing we have to do is close Guantanamo we have to do is to return to the Geneva conventions I actually think that there need to be agreed","62":"and he didn't for the reason you said the only hope I think is to take something that Jim wolfenson said that I sharply agreed with but to use it which is I couldn't believe Jim wolfenson talk to us last night and never mentioned that you read out that you heat he still was thinking about well yeah Britain and France or Germany individually will not be economically hours but the EU today is a bigger power than the United States that you can automatically will gradually get more political power it will never be a unitary state but it to","21":"why we have signed on it 1997 I expected to vote a lot of time in the next 10-20 years to that cuz I don't think the United States can possibly stand for what it says does if it's refuses to be held accountable but I think collectively we can find a way to amend International laws on a. New one that we can all sign on to not perfectly by any means but in a way that that means we are not hypocritical when we actually talk about a word Liberty under law got here in the front","10":"will hold a leadership role in the world and doing that I wonder where the you don't think that it would be a good place for the United stop by a buying those rules itself just as an example I mean your belief and when you with the examples but the United States doesn't accept it stiction of international criminal code of the international court of justice it is in dereliction on the conventions of writing people need I go on it","19":"agree don't agree that we need to ratify all those conventions in fact I think what is salutary about us approach is that we actually want to see a lot of those rights enforced and there's I put to you there's no way Australia would enforce all the rights in the convention on the child parents have no rights and force them all I'm not saying sign up to them I'm not saying follow that follow the the let the spirit of them I think it's important we got in fights on the protocol either there you go but for a fairly good reason if you

with you you got it great set of counters to that what I'm actually more concerned about is that it will lead to a kind of stalling out of things","53":"it's great to say that there are people who carry high-level responsibilities in the United States showing awareness of this but unfortunately it isn't going to be sold at that level when we had composed our report and went around what's the

face the","72":"they're there instinctively just a normal sleep really cuz I think they're right so my question is not like why question is not a whether your vision is correct my question is

dealing with yourself behind the closed door","28":"politics is had to do with this construction of the Islamic fascist best framework that we've now ended up having to deal with and also whether you

it will never be a unitary state but it to count it out I think it's a real mistake but my point is simply perhaps the way we do this is effectively read out Britain and France at every turn unless they're willing to think about it more broadly and within the EU then you have plenty of support for getting rid of nuclear weapons on your second point the op-ed that I published a I haven't seen it but my original title was a world of Partners and I am absolutely agree that the United States needs to return to its alliances","27":"in our neighborhoods in our schools mosques this is part of the Paradox perhaps that you were talking about that we still regard islamofascism is a terror and in terms of Europe the secular project has perhaps not work so well in terms of incorporating Muslim so I

with this construction","56":"throughout the United States and you talked about global organizations and I thought that was fine but the United States for much of the period after 94 85 the chief distinction in the world for being able to run alliances in a Cooperative very intelligent effective way began with FDR goes on through through Truman and Eisenhower and so on and Ronald Reagan in his own way I think was also a good Alliance conductive","41":"agree and and actually had listed it as a separate threat we","15":"when you we talked mateship that's an Australian account of equality likes Fidelity is in the in Europe where the United States doesn't have it doesn't mean we all don't believe in equality we do but we have very different views I think the United States should put on some things but I think there's no possible way that we could tackle all the issues that I laid out if it's up to the United States to lead and I frankly think that the world is ready or willing to have the United States return to some fairly mythical image of us as"}
