right we can we're Americans","11":"reduced from that and they found was just his three color cyan yellow and different combinations that they can paint the whole wide range of different colors and then black gave him really rich dark tones as well but so that took about 50 years of adoption before CMYK was the printing standard across the United States across the world 1956 Pantone Incorporated released a formalization","39":"is there default so here we have histograms on the left we're seeing a images of photograph and it's got a red cast to it and when we pull up levels Photoshop or any Adobe program was he a histogram with shows of all the dark pixels over here all the bright pixels over here and see these like three weird spikes like there's nothing obvious about the image that would suggest why we have those three spikes and we would know","46":"and saturations most saturated part so we can get a lot more information for me so I think it's 3 to 2","85":"thing that's going

in that kind of controls ends up being faster and easier to control more semen intuitive so I forgot what the story is but that's the underlying message is the RGB is better for the hardware because it's closer to the physics anything that interfaces with a human hsl is more intuitive and you know how people do what they're trying to do faster so just real quick cherry on top here","20":"couldn't

50% of women 8% of men have an extra photo pigment that allows them to see more color","37":"down here and over here if you want to make your color just slightly brighter you have to move the the

default","45":"cast to it we look at saturation we can see his hat saying is is like the most saturated in his bowl and some stuff on the table the faces other than that the faces are the most saturated and that's exactly where they want our eyes to go so the the focal area I think you're supposed to be looking at is represented by the most evocative part of the image and saturations most
