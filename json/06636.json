herbarian's","113":"the next project it's more of the idea of data gathering in the in between so this I'm calling it it's it's a progress but I'm calling it Molly Bloom Soliloquy you're one cuz it's taking me a year to get to the point where I'm at now and I thought it would take me a lot last time but last","12":"in related design so what that means is I just produce a variety of work on that","189":"up and yeah it's about time on the wall so it'll be lit properly and everything so yeah so that's all of the works I've got to show today and I think what I've started to realize","16":"always that one that gets out and he asks this question what where he'll find that one tiny microscopic fat fast the whole project that's more of an ascetic decision but a data Define decision and then I'll Stand Up","92":"of the table and I think that's really nice so I had my data and then we also needed to find a way of representing like the","72":"project so Until you realize how the design is based on data which is accessible to these or should they choose to interpret it so I don't know","28":"something the end invention of these types of projects is quite different anyhow another slide from last year","97":"my idea and that turns into a PDF program that then send this PDF to the developers about way they have to use this to generate the elements from that so I don't know whether that's easier or more like useful or sing like no one's really told me yet but that's what that","68":"you know then is then I would be able to if it was something more functional and so depending on how the graphic that graphic result is used is on will help me decide how far I can be a little bit more arbitrary in the decisions I use when representing data so but this one of the best","124":"thing together so for many of my past projects like I've gathered a lot of data by hands often because I like to do it another time necessity because I didn't know how to automate it so because of that I'm really interested in hand notations and hand calculations like I really like the idea of seeing workings out done in pencil or pen on a piece of paper so","39":"I'm still kind of that out and this is what I'm going to talk about so working in the in between","46":"Academic Way and you know for me that's that's okay if I do think that there are different levels of the site that you can take away from a data project so even if that Insight is small I still think it's relevant and important but I do hope that a viewer is able to take way with every project I create a sort of subtle inside that washes over them and it's kind of quiet light way so just just so they get the gist and then not isn't","85":"himself around the website in a variety of different ways and then you can click on to the icon and then go and see that","170":"at having of the numbers and all of the data crumble and fall to the bottom of the map so whole thing is crumbling into dust so again this is using data and then as a as a basis to create a list of work so you know this is definitely more subjective than some of the others and then the final piece in","25":"spoke about the idea of being a data illustrator that are the concept of data illustration because I thought there maybe a third category to sit alongside data","42":"you know of my first things always try to remember is just to be true true and accurate with the data so even even if it's","181":"for the mathematical plans so that's what all of the sketches look like the drawings look like when laid upon each other and that's just a close-up","58":"for a lot of the more illustrative project site I create the data functions of the foundation of of the project upon which is subjective messages is built and then this message is the main element and then finally the way I tried to keep the","193":"play in between is really just a space for experimentation","59":"and then finally the way I tried to keep the subjective emotional side happy is that I try to inspire meaningful connection with the data and a try highlight something of the view or hasn't seen before in order to inspire wonder","185":"these different world a different time periods and that's a three of them look","20":"teal and purple because I like those colors better there is objective data and then there's subjective emoji communication and these two worlds must never meet so this is Border in between these worlds and you don't know when she crossed and they should always be separate but you know of course","194":"play in between is really just a space for experimentation so you know of course has a chance of that designers working in the space will make mistakes but these mistakes Explorations and to seeing how","52":"if they to so now that I look at the data and trying to make sure that I and I guess treating that very well how do I add the Poetry in the emotion so you know I guess poetry is what we talkin about lot this this is","18":"designers made a mistake and I always find really funny it always makes me laugh","69":"but this one of the best ways I found some of the whole process of how I'm trying to balance these two sides is something that the data artist and data visualizer Santiago Ortiz mention in an email when I was thinking discussing the idea that I owe t-shirt and he was hurting he was saying that","166":"Prince is a section of my text I was trying to illustrate so I was trying to show this network the system collapsing and withering be best apocalyptic in between time in the story is called the withering time so","187":"this text underneath it so now I know that there's lots of people out there who are puffer office but I still get a real thrill cable with gloves holding at my work even if it is just a prince so I had to take a picture so this is bezoar the the curator in the picture hanger the mount the fancy guy that hangs them hanging them up and","35":"but today's talk instead of talking about","83":"filme online film Project held 94 elements and its this project initiated by this filmakermike Patterson and what he's doing his he's commissioning short films that tell human stories relating to the first 94 naturally occurring elements found on our planet so he received getting from the wellcome trust in London to create a new website for his film project and so that's where I came on board but unfortunately the","64":"or like for this project where I have this love of handmade notation and had made calculations and so I converted the homemade long multiplication calculations into like each digit into a colored shape to create these like no representations of the cascading digits in these calculations here you know and the reason I did this","145":"I hope grammar is that Chris and then with the second passed through the drawing and redrawing on the relationships of these were I think I might have gone to 80% accuracy if I'm lucky so","45":"data to people so it's just about taking the numbers from the data and generating quite a random indecipherable shape and form from them I think that the you're always need to be able to read what they see so I don't expect the reader or the viewer to be able to use the many of the vigilant stations I create an avairy rigorous and Academic Way and you know for me","86":"in variety of different ways and then you can click on to the icon and then go and see that film a key part of this brief for this element project was that this was not meant to be a very academic scientific way of representing the elements and needed to be less sign seem more approachable unsigned people so I knew I couldn't use anything really really regrets really scientific sent you nothing Atomic looking it needed to be a little bit friendlier than that so","67":"and I think it is really all about context it's really simple answer but you know I think I can definitely get away with more if it's an album or a t-shirt or you know then it is then I would be able to if it was something more","126":"so and this is where I feel this project kind of Falls in this in between space the way that I've decided to","32":"to on projects where I've been able to explore the idea of illustrating the state of further and it's these few projects I'll talk about now the big reveal and well it's not really big reveal","190":"show and I think what I've started to realize when it comes to you are working in this in-between space between subjective communication and objective data is that I really think that you need to know the rules to know how much you can bend girls hope I think it's only you can only make these decisions if you really are grounded in a good sense of kind of need to know how to do the things right way to break it like many different spaces","82":"so now it's a show you some new data was facing projects that put those ideas into practice these principles instruction to the first project is a project I did for a filme online film Project held 94 elements","75":"the tag okay the quadrants that each represent a question it's cracked on the tag that is the right one in case you want to pour over your t-shirt for hours question one starts at 1 and then it goes goes clockwise in case you in every case you're really into it but I like I woke up early like with jet lag like pressing about this and no one else but anyway","87":"looking it to be a little bit friendlier than that so I knew we still need that","179":"data was I looked at online herbarian's and did lots of research looking for as many numbers as I can find for how each one of these each one of these weeds was Richard and I used these of the reference point in the mid numbers I found like numbers of flowers numbers of petals for each one of the each one of the weed pipes and I use them as a basis","61":"connection so I think this is why I would like these two projects I'm the one on the left shows the structure part 1 of on the road by Jack Kerouac the same was applied on the right to the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin and that when I did with Craig mcinerney but so you know I like to work with literature and it's one of those great ways of relating to others and it's something that Rouses powerful emotion and","36":"today's talk instead of talking about why don't code it will be about this usual simple between objective logical design and design decisions and emotional subjective design decisions that naturally occur in the process of working with data and Piccadilly in this space I'm calling date illustration and so the idea of dated like the name Dale she","98":"no one's really me yet but that's what that woman's look like I'm just by using the using V electron shell numbers as a basis to create these forms here so if you look at them close up you can see that there's this really bottle inside I mean in the contacts this isn't meant to be an academic visualization but you can kind of get the chance to see that they are related to","174":"floor then from that all of these weeds are growing so all of these These are still use data to create them they're all based well they're all meant to represent different we so you find in London so the type of weeds that you find on the roadside are on canals weeds are indigenous to hunted so for this originally I wanted to do is to look","161":"of the cities with line kind of doing an arbitrary triangulation of the different capital cities where I'm cheesing with try how to draw instead of having a computer do it so each lots of data on their lots of the measurements are determined so Capital City the altitude of shown the distance between the capital cities is","186":"time periods and that's a three of them look like together and then it's going to look like this the exhibition so with this text underneath it so now I know that","22":"except for maybe a select few that we could probably all think of who are quite prominent on the internet in a variety of ways but it up for me and I think this is a result of being sent to Catholic school when I was young as I have always seen a fundamentalist attitude is of a challenge so I mean it's not the only reason why","24":"here year i o I spoke about the idea of","73":"they choose to it so I don't know who failed a survey did some of you did okay oh wow that's good good about so with the survey there were 11 questions they were yes or no questions and I picked these four teas for the t-shirt and then all the questions relate to kind of bad behavior on the job or just being a baddie in the workplace like using Mac intaktics soccer ball illegal Behavior","119":"codes overtook it so the longest","156":"eat you can't read the whole story with the images it so you can read Snippets of the story and then look at the images just exploring narrative different types of narrative I guess so those are just examples of some of the preliminary work by other designers for so you can see that it's quite diverse a really diverse range of designers here and these are my","53":"you know I guess poetry is what we talkin about lot this this is I thought I'd sent that word so to me to add this to the projects I create","116":"structure sentences so figuring out what words modify other words and what the relationship relationships between different words are in a sentence in that really appeals to and I really wanted to do a project with this for ages but never gotten around to it and so I thought well I should actually get off my but why I decided to do is to tackle something really big that dealt with sentences so I thought well maybe the","23":"is of a challenge so I mean it's not the only reason why I'm interested in this but it's one of the reasons why it's here in this hazy blurry in between space. this is why I like to work in this in-between world this this is why I work today work with data here last year i o","27":"designer wants communicate is usually more emotional and subjective than once found in the data and often the state as secondary and use as an objective mean sua subjective end so I thought designers designers like me and needed a space really working where they wouldn't be held to the same rules and restrictions as data visualization in and information design something often the end invention of these types of","56":"so when I'm looking for this meeting for data to use this is sort of this middle access that you don't see it at the end is where the where data visualization is happening as I look for insight and then afterwards I select the most appropriate insight to create form in the thoughts what becomes that a telestration another thing I try to do it"}
