Up Now scam but then they're vouching for the program and they're saying how it actually not a scam and it's the real deal","43":"shows here sort of ko ko liking to see sort of regions of the graph have different colors where people who like each other's content right so it's kind of gives you a little bit of a sense for the communities and we didn't have too much time to get to study this but for example the red area on the right is more set of people caring about fashion you get lipstick in and powder and all these things so every region sensitive a different interest group there's a fitness group there's the WakeUpNow region but","75":"think has time for lawsuit yeah we","34":"Chad we got chat on the phone I'm Chad Jardine ER is the chief marketing officer the chief recruiting

see people searching for Wake Up Now you see incredible surge over the past year right so they're doing something and there's something clearly happening are there more people searching for it more people seeing it and possibly more people engaging in it and that question and we asked Chad and he was really surprised we called like how did you get my number and we are on the phone with him for half an hour when I going to play the the audio is too boring","48":"also lots of the the members of wake up now it's a blessed and and well just just religious terms and then the visuals the Aesthetics were like you know the big so we didn't really have enough time to statically determine what is the connection between any religious organizations and wake up now and then of course it's based in Utah so I was thinking Mormon anyway one of our one at one of our unanswered questions from this experiment","76":"for yeah we fell in love with","12":"like","81":"president makes the most it goes down from there that's so the real kind of you heard that but yeah he hissed his former job along with another CEO was in the real estate market and so I think you know if we had like a really
