{"30":"can get the elevation changes you know from today's stage here's where they they started down at Whittlesey no Mansion going from there all the way up there it's it's like an uphill climb all the way 3/4 the day was almost running uphill please cyclists use all this information and the really great athletes use this information they know what their heart rate should be here here here here here all the way along that they know what speed they should be going they","33":"should be putting into it on the flip side but I have strategies and on how to deal with heels how to deal with the Saints you know if they're coming down downhill at 80 kilometers an hour and all the sudden stop and think I'm feeling a bit nervous here again that's it so if they know they get nervous some descendants they need to have a mental strategy to deal with I need to put something into place to ensure that that nervousness doesn't get in the way of","41":"Triathlon FL pole dancing diving anything like that they all do this and the great ones do it very very well","32":"understand how you can be your best because they like the can't afford to be bad but just kind of food it so they break it down is all of this sort of thing for my to really get an understanding you know this is even the even talked about power the amount of wattage that the cyclist is putting out and they know every bit of the rice how much they should be putting into it on the flip side","40":"happen what's what they're going to do from the physical the mental that's what makes them cry and that's how they perform at the top level on a regular basis because they have all these three things in place how long do I the mental the physical and the mechanics and that's what an elite athlete does across all sports there's not a difference you take cycling away go into any Elite Sport whether it's Marathon running Triathlon FL pole","16":"further in the Peloton you know you could have a hundred Riders all smoking along at 60 kilometers an hour you know you touching shoulder sometimes take your finger off the pulse Clipper Rider with the pedal shoulder handlebar anything and that's it you could be taking out half the Peloton so there's zero margin for error on this side of that equation this stuff is easy to understand it's this stuff that seems elusive to good act like","11":"a laid-out sort of plan it it's like a sheet music there just got every note that they have to be able to get out across those fog. So it's really not about the rice it's about the execution of client and there's a lot of players involved in that fine if from a cycling perspective we take away the other athletes on their team and they 2 Chainz and just focus on the athlete there's even a significant amount that we have to look at to really get inside what they're doing","21":"motions in the nervous energy bit of excitement a bit of tension but it's in check the athletes that don't have it in check usually start off too fast are they do something silly you know I'm feeling good alright I just won't take a drink when I'm supposed to have a drink they won't do that sort of thing you know they're monitoring already have I warmed up enough did I do enough this morning what speed are we starting at at is the Peloton going to be nuts this morning go out of the gun if","39":"to be able manage those two that's when they're at their worst and there's no margin for error again on the on the mental side of things so they know to put this into practice and they need to do it on a day in and day out by ISIS most of them by the time I get to Rice die their whole race plan they don't even think about it they know kilometer by kilometer what's going to happen what's and what they're going to do from the physical the mental","7":"have time I can about that so if we will look at an elite athlete in general and soda peel away and Look Under The Helmet it's it's Courtney's tonight ask this question a lot what's the difference between good athletes and great athletes and really it is there's not a lot of significant between them there's marginal differences what's really interesting and then the next question is that were statement that I usually get is what's 90%","9":"physical things so it's an absolute power but what's interesting about that sort of anecdote or analogies is if you put competition into that that equation a chain changes everything so when when you're looking at the competitiveness that these athletes have to get to that's where there's periods of time where yes it is 9010 sort of scenario so if we look at sort of the whole competitiveness of of","25":"when the third category 243 climbed Rin and they're tired say their emotions are in the toilet the legs are killing them the fussing I can't get up here I'm just not pedaling fast enough when I slow down this is their job they can't afford to do that it's not like I said the end of the day we get to go home and going to bed we still get pie these guys if they don't perform they don't get paid so that they can't afford to do","10":"we look at sort of the whole competitiveness of of Elite athlete it's really not about the rice the rice is for spectators and that's what everyone loves to say they go through this great Orchestra of 5 days of absolute intense rivalry up heels down heels the Criterium at the end but it's really not about essentially for the elite athlete all they're doing is there executing a well laid-out sort of plan it it's","26":"guys if they don't they don't get paid so that they can't afford to do that sort of thing so these athletes at this level or really on that knife edge and in this becomes more important particularly towards the end know if you think those last last 2 km of a rice you know if you're not a sprinter then I'll pay you don't have to worry about it but you just got to get to the end but the Sprint is in because I've also had to ride the whole way but now it's their job to Sprint to the end so their whole race plan","29":"site on the web so from a heart rate and cycling computer stuff they get all this information you got soda average bike Cadence of how fast they're there their speed and average speed you know here this was I you know 200 230 k stage the average 43 kilometers per hour you know mean wall the elevation changes I have them there but you can get the elevation changes you know from today's stage","34":"to ensure that that nervousness doesn't get in the way of the actual performance because the goal is a getting to the end and getting into the end in the in the best best possible why look like 10 so this again more of these really practically easy things the mechanics and the physical side of things from the mental side of things","35":"the physical of things from the mental side of things again it always comes back to Piper work and paperwork which why good athletes don't necessarily like it too much but the great athletes their pedantic about the paperwork there training journals their food Diaries you know their mental state Diaries all these sorts of things so that whenever I've had an athlete typically will get them to complete this which is the athletes mental age inventory there's lots of them out there but it covers","19":"get out of hand it that can ruin your performance as well talk a little bit more about that behavioral things so what's going on speed is actually happening are they 50 km an hour when they should be at 48 are they going up the hill too fast these sorts of performance things I have to be monitoring they have to understand what that is because what their brains doing constantly and everyone when does this is it evaluate to","17":"understand this stuff that seems elusive to good act like but great athletes do everything and anything to try to get into that that spice so we really look at at what's going on Under The Helmet for these athletes and sort of they I'll call him the zones of functioning that athletes need to be actually beef who sing on in in order to get to that next level we start here this sort of the body Association they have to be in tune with their bodies every second of that Rice as soon as they","42":"do it very well","43":"it very well","8":"that I usually get is what's 90% mental 10% physical and it's just an absolute fallacy it really is from an elite cyclist perspective they're spending 50 60 70 hours a week physically doing something whether it's cycling weights massage and yes massage and physical and so there's no way that only 10% of their time is doing physical things so it's an absolute power but what's interesting","22":"at at the Peloton going to be nuts this morning go out of the gun if so what are we going to do about that notice to compensate for that meanwhile how am I thinking Whitworth what sort of thoughts might have am I thinking I'm feeling strong today am I thinking my legs going to make it over those category climbs today those sorts of thoughts need to have this in check if you can imagine the too excited their heart rates too high the starting to produce too much stress chemicals","6":"220 beats a minute now they'll reach speeds probably double 40 cases of coming down heels you know so there's a lot of intensity over the next five days they have to do dying and die out and inspect titers we sort of stand there and sort of a run-on do that how do they actually put themselves through this Soto and Wishin and endurance and get to the end and it most the time the smiling at the end which which is quite interesting which we have time I can about that so","24":"they have to be doing this all the time in order to make sure but their performances is onto in 5 hours just think that the mental strain of doing this every day through Polaroid compared to the physical something out actually paying attention this in their planning in their training it's going to be very very hard to turn up the guy and get through through that's where the rice to get through the times when the third category","4":"alright thanks everyone I'll just","37":"is here at 30% boy they're in trouble and some athletes come to me in and that's where they're at in their their size of their their career fortunately that's when I come when I should have came up sooner when it was around 60 but then because it's athletes who never individuals we always talk about athletes as being the sort of reclusive talk people they're always in tamed but your coach unit machinist your physio","3":"alright thanks everyone I'll","28":"towards that that Sprint finish then they're not going to do their job so how did the how did the manage with all of this you know there's there's lots of tools out there I've caught some screenshots here this is from Page 6 of the Tour de France this year Christian vandevelde if anyone's heard of him barely good cyclist this is from the the Garmin Cervelo upload site on the web so from a heart rate and cycling","5":"alright thanks everyone I'll just so to recap what this whole event is is 5 days 678 km of cycling around Victoria in a V athletes are you know they're going to put themselves through a bit of pain dies now reaching average Spades probably 40 kinds in our heart rights that would probably make most people pass out as they're going out unit 220 beats a minute now they'll reach speeds probably double","38":"unit machinist your physio you massage your psychologist if you if you're lucky enough to have one I need to understand how they interact in the team as well it's not just the internal stuff it's the external stop to being a plate it's not just getting on the bike and pedaling you know it's about doing a lot of different things in order to go from good to cry and to be able to manage those two that's when they're at their worst","20":"and everyone when does this is it evaluate to perceive Xanax the constantly evaluating thinking interpreter interpreting all play signals and I also have work together and in this system inside The Athlete's head determine what action or inaction they're actually going they can imagine at the start of a a stage like this morning and they're ready to get out of Whittlesey most athletes their motions in the nervous energy bit of excitement","23":"high starting to produce too much stress chemicals does thinking too negative for going to be distracted and then something's going to go wrong in their body and then their performance is going to decline so this whole cycle it's going on second-by-second as they're going so you can think about not only do they have to ride it was it slow 107 yard km up a few Hills along the way and down the other side but they have to be doing this all the time in order to","13":"tell athletes it's the mechanics of it so it's your equipment You Know Your Heart Right Stuff and then all the paperwork yes there's a lot of paperwork involved for elite athletes that I have to do a lot of paperwork stuff just think thing about these two areas though is there's margins of are there in the elite athlete they can accept that yes sometimes the equipment isn't going to work and get a flat sometimes petals fall off sometimes brakes fail sometime spokes break you know all these sorts","14":"fail sometime spokes break you know all these sorts of things no the physical side of things sometimes they miss a feed store for drop food or drop a bottle or don't get a drink so they have to account for if they are there and they can accept that get down to this brain down here which is the Mind side of things unfortunately at the elite level there's no margin for error that there's there's nothing that they can do cuz as soon as I","31":"the way along that they know what speed they should be going they know typically What stages of the Rye they're going to feel like absolute rubbish because I know because they trying it and if they don't trying it and they can't plan for always tell my athletes I want to be great so you can't plan for the worst hope for the best you plan for the worst to be the best because you got understand when you going to be at your worst understand how you can be your best because they like the can't afford to be","27":"their job Sprint to the end so their whole race plan is to get them for that last hundred 250 meters where they need to Sprint and in that leading up to that if they haven't done this the extra pressure that they have to put on themselves to get through that is it is next to Impossible another thoughts have to be right there body has to be perfect their motions either better be very positive or at least knew I've been feeling negative and not very confident towards that that Sprint finish then they're not going to do their","36":"athletes age inventory there's lots of them out there but it covers things like they're wearing ass and awareness two things around them as well as a -2 things inside the you know how good are they at strategizing and and using strategies athletes have to be really good strategizes what's their focus like confidence competitive will discipline and actually getting an understanding and then the act like inside well these guys if their will is down here at 30% boy they're in trouble and some","15":"there's nothing that they can do cuz as soon as I allow a margin of error to come into their mental plan that's it time over you can imagine 150 pies in a rice climbing up a 10% dried and then coming down the other side at 8 United far km an hour heads not in it one wrong move and let's sit your roadkill across the rug so they take it one step further even in the Peloton you know you could have a hundred Riders","12":"we have to look at to really get inside what they're doing teammates critically important as is understanding the other teams as well but we won't talk about that tonight so the individual athlete who are the pliers the the physical at. Are you caught the the muscles the heart the lungs the physiology the grunting in the sweating and all those the things and then you've got down here which is my sort of tell my athletes it's the mechanics of it so it's your equipment","18":"with their bodies every second of that Rice as soon as they they start off off the gun after I understand what the heart rate is what they're breathing is what their muscles are doing all those sorts of things on the flip side what they're feeling athletes need to be some of the best emotional people and understanding their emotions than most people because from a performance perspective as soon as get out of hand that's it that can ruin your performance as"}
