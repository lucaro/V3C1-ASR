That it has generating the the army","42":"as you can see we can ready mostly animated we could have made this one but would we want here it's 2 now apply does the skin modifier because right now this is the only movie in the vertices of the base match not the actual generator topology right and also we can to school this one because he's being generated","29":"the chest right so let's see here the fingers how is option affects it so you can see it like more or less is more here in this model it's not having great effects but the inside message probably eat heatmax difference between about topology with weird stuff to a better one right now it's Moon shading mates the the","8":"e set and here we have our first baseman we're going to use it into this now before using the ski modified we are going to create in this is how you're some kind of humanoid base match soap for this humanoid how did we won a mirror effect because we are going tomorrow only one arm and one leg but we wanted to have the two sides of the body","57":"you the Nestle toriel and hobby blending","20":"or a gray KY3 says yes to the show you how this works of course if you go to lender artist or some form of light you will see that there are people that has created a lot of great stuff only using this key modifier so it's possible to do it not in this tutorial okay I'm here we are going to have the mesh","14":"to watch model like this so let's add for now I should be Vision surf it's over","31":"one to this one that'll be and this one won't have an actual effect on the generator topology let's see how it works Mark looks after selecting it with market news and you can see the generator topology goes from this one to this one and this one who is Khaled we control A1 have any effect on the generator topology right which is exactly what we want now we can clear","33":"the geometry is made with some rotations and all that stuff coming from the root bone right with now this one if we change it","18":"the we have the option to come to a vertex and select is thickness with control a we can scale it iPod and also after pressing Ctrl a we can press X or Y to Define DX we want to scale these bear attacks in right so for now let's","52":"and set this is a really basic and we're the model what I did here right now but you going if you go to some","26":"right so now let's take a look at the options we have in this modifier first me after you the option that is disabled right now because we are in the edit mode which is it create Armature options this will create from this from this message you're creating it will create an Armature that allows us to move and hear this","35":"from here so you can see that the geometry here is like coming from that part but if we mark want to screw it it's more symmetrical right","17":"a face from these vertices and you can see that it ignores the face and just take the edges right this is pretty useful also because sometimes we want structure like a metal structure for building or something like that to look to have fakeness in this modifier help us achieve that effect right chords without the subsurface we have the option to come to a","49":"right we should put the arms in t like this is like 60 sister gray why this is not the purpose of the toilet so you better try to create voluntarily t-shape or something that is going to be useful then when scalding for now let's just go with it so let's go to this mode and you can see","44":"in a way like if we create a model or there to see in the left side it will go on to replicate into the right side nothing like that that's why we used the mirror modifier so here what we are going to do is to apply this modifier right now the Armature Works sadly sadly the same not as Harley the same and Betty forms the final","4":"hi everyone I'm only there from","37":"useful effects so we can select one for sample and escallate only into 1 axis like these 1 and sadly we say like oh no but I wanted to be you know uniform in both taxes lokir equalize ready and it's kind of a square yet and we can is Kelly with control a normally and put right where we want it","45":"and Betty forms the final match of the final message nothing like this the final match is this very cubicle guy but he's enough for now so this is what's happening okay so you can start animating already c'est la vie yeah yeah I'm having fun with this so when you","13":"over it so we can disable this one probably you are ready disabled I think is disabled by the volume lender but I always have it enabled so disabled and we can see inside that mesh so now it's a little uncomfortable to watch the model like this so let's add for now I should be","30":"now it's Moon shading mates the the debate is not to be generated flat but smooth right we are going to let it like this now. Mark Lewis in clear lose is something that when did I want to show you a loose vertex is a better than one p computer into the skin modifier in pass through it and will join this one to this one that'll be and this one won't have","47":"you should do now is to apply how much of a solution modifier","54":"version of blender doesn't have this yet you can just download some newest version from graphical. Org butt anyway in a couple of weeks all the versions of Lando should have this one because is it when a 2.64 will be released this if everything goes as scheduled so","32":"which is what we want now we can clear whenever we want with clear loose and also we can select several ones and mark them as Loose as you can see nice Mark fruit wheel Define words apology starts to be generated I don't understand that very well but I think that that the geometry is made with some","50":"so let's go to this mode and you can see that we can start discussing","40":"Fairly Odd Future we are mature so we are going to create Jama to bed before we're going to apply the mirror because if we created right now we are going to create just once side of the Armature because he's the one that this key modifier is working on soap first we're going to apply this one now this this is ski modified this is the","7":"first I'm going to create a plane in displaying will be our men out our mess the message we are going to apply the skin modifier into so we wanted to be for starting Justin Bieber thinks so select all the vertices of the plane press all-time and Ascender so now we only have one birthday cakes that's stupid with e set and here we have our","9":"one but we wanted to have the two sides of the body of course so that's how first I mirror modifier","43":"and also we can to school this one because he's being generated on the Fly by the skin modifier or ISO is not actually used rice out here the Symmetry axis is just to help the skin modifier to understand how does symmetry is working in the because it doesn't generate geometry for s in a symmetrical way like if we create a model or there to","34":"with now this one if we change it sometimes it change how it apology is being creative let's take a look Market Street and you can see that now prodigies more symmetrical before it was generated from here so you can see that the geometry here is like","38":"and put right where we want it now this one we can probably scan it like this and we can solve some problems here going to the next step right in this is why I'm going to show you the workflow for actually going to to a model okay so here you can see that just generated some generating some more vertices","36":"mark want to screw it it's more symmetrical right also it defines the root bone of the skeleton that will be generated with the Creator mature option right now equalize ready okay this is pretty weird name I mean it's not bad intuitive but it does have a nice UNM useful effects so we can select one for sample","48":"how much of a solution modifier and subdivided a couple of times so now we have exactly the same that we have before we subdivision modifier but now we can actually it's called this one cause we can movies like these or these but we should make any 9 units to metric away or right but we should put the","12":"to the skin modifier and here we have the basement did you create now it's creating a match based on the birthday as you can see and give them some kind of sickness all right what we want here is to see what we are doing in the in the original match because the original match it's like this and it's a little difficult to select stuff if we have this match over it so we can disable this","16":"topology unfortunately some sometimes it's a little difficult to handle but we will try later so let's continue to it generates the mesh as we model right yes with vertices and with because if we have it faces let's take a look I'm going to generate a face from these vertices and you can","21":"okay I'm here we are going to have the mesh the Hat sorry I see that this one's we subdivided what is here we can use all the tools that we normally use for modeling so it's nice we have these ones and these ones we want to scale them to have some kind of nice head","10":"so that's how first I mirror modifier k i in the x axis course this axis and let's go here honest rude this one guy so we can see the effect there we go now after the mirror modifier we're going to the skin","19":"so for now let's best forget that and keep modeling and we will see all these options here what they mean and what they do so let's go ahead and create the arm should we want Rolex you see the steel toe we are going also to to see what it is later so I'm not going to create a masterpiece or a gray KY3 says yes to","51":"go to this mode and you can see that we can start discussing let's put the Symmetry on the x-axis and just started so as you can see it's a really easy and fast way to generate your base match okay sweetie nice and say set this is a really basic and we're","22":"to some kind of nice head have you have the neck okay not at school for the pants here and I'm creating a awesome Lance is going to show you how you can create some fingers so as you can see the apology is generated on the Flyers modulo remove the bettis's so you need to do it in a","6":"to sculpt so it in base the creation of matches if you know zbrush and the Seas Fierce is something right because I just creating vertices and shooting them we can create a base mesh out of them okay so we need to tell her we are going to see how the is them in which options we have for creating this matches so let's get it started first I'm going to create a plane","24":"and as you can","53":"now you going if you go to some to some form and see what people is doing with this modifier is really amazing really amazing version of blender doesn't have this yet","28":"for that but anyway we will see how to use it later the branch smoothing is an option that will set up the way in which branches are being smooth a branch is Bertha's that has more than two edges coming out from it like a disc cross your fingers or hear the chest right so let's see here the fingers how is","5":"hi everyone I'm only there from lenses.com and it is a toy we're going to see how to use the skin modifier skin modifier has been out of the latest version blender is going to be released officially into the 2.64 version schedule for this month and eats hair when creating base matches to sculpt later so it in base the creation of matches","23":"modulo the bettis's so you need to do it in a way that it doesn't generate wisdom for a sample if you see something like this you better move the vertex and did you find a nice position for it this looks fine and I computer you can start adding your fingers","27":"this and the move our mesh and post it right pretty similar to the Sea spheres in zbrush right of course. The Armature we can use it later for the final character bed while it's not a problem tenant for that but anyway we will see how to use it later","56":"That it has generating the the army Jason Aldean is really useful is really fast to generate bass message that you can sculpt and yep I hoped it was you talk to you in the Nestle toriel and hobby blending","41":"this is ski modified this is the match that we created is symmetrical and all that stuff we can go ahead and create an ARMA 2 from it there we go again see that here in the route where we had selected the root of the I'm the skeleton it created another bone there to be the route now as you can see we can ready","15":"so let's for now I should be Vision surf it's over like two subdivisions that we go and hear the message you can see he's not really a symmetrical but handle that later hopefully because sometimes the ski modifier generates this kind of not symmetrical Parts in the topology unfortunately some sometimes"}
