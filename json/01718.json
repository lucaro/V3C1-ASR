{"16":"the cloud so we often think about onboarding but we don't always think about wording and there's real business requirements that you take something like Office 365 and you have a lot of critical data out there and so if you are dating you need to protect it and so pull it down out of the cloud put it in your backup repository because what happens if an administrator accidentally deletes a gigabyte of data if you don't have protection or do you have a t Discovery request that says you know go find this","11":"is the for object storage a lot of large Enterprise customers I understand we want to leverage object storage for a scale up in scale of characteristics as an archived here and so obviously waiting outside but it also a number of other features there not any less important one of those is the universal storage API so we have Integrations inversion time with IBM Lenovo and Canada and one of","21":"and one of the ways that we deal with it is by put agent inside the OS because otherwise you have to be able to read and understand how the hypervisor function so whether it be Google Cloud Weatherby Azure Weatherby Amazon Weatherby bloom any of these you can put an agent in it that's true of kbm as well however you mention something specific which was Amazon we do believe there's value in leveraging the new technologies that are available in Cloud Solutions and so what","7":"I was thinking of a company called s town we did hosted virtual desktops and that was acquired by VMware back in 2013 so it's been a few years they're working with a lot of cloud providers offering services and one of them it became very evident is the mission critical nature of providing availability for all of these services and so I joined in January of 2017 and it has been a blur having a lot of fun you know","9":"he went over some of the new features that he was excited about but what are some of the new features that that excite you and you think you're going to be great for moving forward with your Cloud strategy sure so in the flagship product there is he in the Veil really sweet really five big features in that are the two that I'm most excited about I'll leave with those when is continuous data protection so this essentially uses the atmosphere can I fry oil filtering and it will","10":"the can I fry oil filtering and it will intercept the io flow from the hypervisor down to the storage and it will replicate that off to you or Disaster Recovery low did I give you a recovery Point objective of seconds as opposed to minutes and that's very exciting especially if you're focused on the disaster recovery space second big thing I'm really excited about inversion 10 is the support for object storage a lot of large","19":"they have a specific I answer security requirement that this cloud has but this Cloud doesn't so this multi Cloud ability to move things within the cloud is also a Big Driver now I know you guys are doing stuff with AWS as well and other custom panel somebody mentioned that it would be great if they could cover cable containers do you see maybe a future and being able to solve those","17":"do you have a t Discovery request that says you know go find this particular material if you don't have control of that date it's hard to comply SO2 the card from the card and then within the beginning to see emerging but applications that are born in the cloud but they still need protection that the cloud is a very good at giving High availability but they don't necessarily give business availability and what I mean by that is if someone intentionally or unintentionally","8":"a lot of fun you know we've we've been covering the space for a while now and we've been to all the other the VM on you think so the company growing that it's pretty pretty awesome can you tell us likes the new teachers that we had I know we talked a little bit with with Rick earlier and he went over some of the new features that he was excited about but what are some of","22":"new technologies that are available in Cloud Solutions and so what we're doing there is an agent list capture of that VM without putting an age inside doing it at the storage level and as we go forward you know we look to provide these types of capabilities across all of these services question of priority and and market share","6":"we're here at mom 2017 in New Orleans and I'm speaking with Danny Allen the vice president of cloud and Alliance strategy so how did you come to to be part of the game so my background is mostly in the security space and virtualization space I was thinking of a company called s town we did","24":"speak with you and thank you for taking the time to speak with me I'm blog wish you success in the future and will keep keep an eye out on what you guys are doing","20":"a future and being able to solve those issues and those problems of course interact differently with the operating systems on top so ESX uses a binary translation and then does a pair of virtualization so one of the challenges with that has been dealing with that abstraction that abstract and let her and so one of the ways that we deal with it is by put agent","23":"life a lot easier not having to worry about you know do they have the way to say engine on meets machine and new 1500 bm2 takes a long time to go and update them all everything every time a new agent comes out so yes agentless definitely is the preferred approach if it's possible speak with you and thank you for taking the time to speak with me I'm","13":"requirement to protect physical workload sometimes that have not been virtualized or machines at a run the cloud for example or you don't have hypervisor access until we can use the agent base management within being back up your application to protect those were closed so a lot of exciting things the app that's fairly new for being that now you're not just virtual machines it's also physical machines yes so so","14":"also machines yes so so bring you into other areas like security that is becoming you know the possible solution for some their security needs as well what are your thoughts on the future of of where you're going with with your Cloud strategy the pockets in the to the cloud from the","15":"in the to the cloud from the cloud and within the clouds on the to the cloud space you can see how a lot of customers use us to do backup to the cloud and that can be a virtual machines can be physical machines give me Cloud machine that can also be V cut capability by the way was not a store and still pushing nose up to the cloud as a backup or for Disaster Recovery the second category from the cloud so we often think about onboarding but we don't always","12":"inversion time with IBM Lenovo and Canada and one of the ways that we did that was we created a universal API that they could write two so that we can Leverage The snapshotting Technologies Ark Gloria Smith in there the other big another big future the fourth feature is agent management so we are known as the organization that does protection for ver all machines but they're still the requirement to protect physical workload sometimes that","18":"I mean by that is if someone intentionally or unintentionally delete some thing or causes an issue it gives you the protection that you need if you have that backup or business continuity across clouds and increasingly were seeing this multi Cloud environment sometimes just because the cloud provider doesn't have a point of presence in a particular country and there's data sovereignty rules or maybe they have a specific I answer security requirement that this"}
