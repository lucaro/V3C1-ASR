evaluate it and come was something that was a little bit different while still being very much the same thing with an over-the-shoulder design first of all the ergonomics of the camera really great so it's it's something that if you look at most cameras small form-factor camera","39":"it a lot of that high frequency noise with 4K resolutions you really pulls out a lot of detail and you want that detail but you don't want to create more a patterns in the image and that filter actually helps with that side effects of that is that you can use standard ND filters up at the front here on a matte box you don't have to get the more expensive ndir filter so that's all taken care of 4 file formats on the back end of the camera we actually have a slot where our media goes this is our Pak media

that's basically a 1.4 offset from a 35 mm sensor so very close to 35 mm sensor at the front weave done actually kind of interesting stuff on that sensor we put two filters on it that are built into the sensor ones an infrared filter that filters out infrared light which can kind of pollute answer a little bit and alter the color that you end up with and we also put in an optical low-pass filter what that does is it removes a lot of that high frequency noise with 4K","71":"Cool Math","36":"box don't have to buy a lot of special stuff so the sensor on the","12":"you look most cameras small
