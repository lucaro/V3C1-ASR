that","30":"find a call Brian and Julie understand and appreciate everything he did when he was at his greatest but the reality is teams look at them they see a guy really shouldn't play the field anymore just has too much trouble moving around doesn't give you any baserunning can hit left-handers has trouble against the power Believers in only he's a guy you really have to pick your spots to play almost purely as a","33":"wrong about Howard but you're probably right","32":"the circumstances are not right for him to play anymore I hope he's okay with that because he did sings that very few players have ever done in Philadelphia have ever done Dover that's okay that's what I was getting anyway I'm speaking to being over we're just about out of time I hope you're wrong about Ryan Howard but you're probably right","2":"happy to join here on Philly Press Box radio by espn.com senior baseball writer Jason start Jason thanks for taking a few minutes of your time to talk with me hey Jason Major League Baseball coming off a season that end of the Fantastic World Series 7 games the finale going Extra Innings the Cubs of course winning it all for the first 108 years what did that great

underrated the Joey Votto has on-base skills that come along once in a generation and I think we could leave seem to be something else you know something that he's not built to be people knocked down what he's really good at not everybody has that ability to go to home plate and swing at 9 strikes and","7":"so think one way to put it is there floor is now higher than it's been in a really long time and so every guy High Valley now has to force his way to the big leagues has to earn the right to take the place of the guy playing there now so it's a really interesting point evolution of the franchise as they try to get back to what they were and where they go from here is fascinating to me and some of that's","9":"mcphail and that talking charge a lot of smart decisions and you can see what they're trying to do now with a cups he thinks they're following the Cubs Playbook on a lot of different levels the way they tore it down the way they traded to prospects the way they try to load up on prospects away Fitness signed a bunch of players were traded for Bunch players in the last year there Deals they can flip them in July Cubs turn Scott","25":"Michael barkann Merrill Reese your old pal Glen macnow another sting relations on that honor really one of the coolest things that ever happened to me in my life but you mentioned a bunch of people that are already in this Hall of Fame are my heroes and many of them are my friends and you didn't mention somebody like Harvey Pollock everything that I write","10":"last year Deals they can flip them in July Cubs turn Scott Feldman did Jake Arrieta steel self they're following the Playbook I mean I guess my question about","26":"that I write and some of that is because I got exposed to people like Harley Pollock and the way they appreciate the creativity would what you can use the numbers of Fame about 20 years until a lot of people listening I never even heard him what's up buddy you heard Dave zinkoff most","29":"something one final question Ryan Howard anybody going to take a shot on him I know the Rockies have an injury could they possibly find Howard a shot I just don't see it at this point I could really take a step back and you think about it you know the last couple of years and he was in Philadelphia country that guy back at the end and they couldn't find a taker call Brian and Julie","19":"underrated are the kind of things that they're really tough let me think about this I think these things through though extremely underrated we haven't really thought a lot about Paul Goldschmidt and his career and all the","17":"many times he's got the most unique Hall of Fame credentials many shortstop to ever play there really is nobody like him nobody who combines the home runs and the Steals and the gold gloves and the MVP and just the whole power speed defense value factor I think if he were to have another couple of years to add of those credentials in some way that he's got a chance right now he's short for","8":"where they from here is fascinating to me and some of that's going to unfold it says a lot is going to unfold in Allentown to from 2007 to 2011 X were very good for the Phillies you Chronicle their world series title in your book the wait tales of the 2008 Phillies all those guys are gone now either retired or playing elsewhere but it sounds like you think the pills are on the right track today with Pete McCann and Addie mcphail and that talking charge a lot of smart","22":"home plate and swing at 9 strikes and turn them into production show me bottles so programmed to swing at strikes and nothing but strikes and said that because of that I think we sometimes Miss what he as well overrated to give me an overrated guy too I don't think he's going to be listening so I got to give me an overweight again is overrated wow","6":"players on the 2017 Phillies what day will be in the lineup at that position the next time they play a postseason game but I do think there's a major league player at every position and find a troop AAA at Lehigh Valley there is a prospect at every position on the diamond except the third base in the whole rotation so I think one way to put it is there floor","24":"more exciting to watch when takes the ball and Stephen Strasburg but this is about building a career and its best value to a team and I don't think he's ever been what we thought he would date or even what is he needing to be good point hey and may Jason you'll be inducted in the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of joining other Philly media greats like the late Frank Dalton Phil Jazzman Stan Hoffman plus under the Kramer Michael barkann Merrill Reese your old pal Glen macnow another sting","4":"because of it happened the way to games folded and who plays for that team this is a bunch of really magnetic personalities who were very willing to share it I don't share it with the world talk show circuit going Saturday Night Live I think they make it so easy to connect with their team that it would have been special memorable no matter what but it's way more special and way more memorable because of all that","3":"I think that was one of the most significant World Series in the most in living at Modern Baseball history obviously because of who won first off what's the World Series or any kind of Championship so that get your attention but really went beyond that because of how it happened the way to games folded and who","28":"an honored that this happened to me was just a hunch Jason but I think the Jewish Hall of Fame honor is important for your terrific work on the great Sports debate on Prison back in the 90s Glen macnow beat me today show me I've gotten in but it's Wednesday and I'm in maybe Rodger something chat one final question Ryan Howard anybody going to take a shot on him","5":"way more special and way more memorable because of all that absolutely I know you've been making the rounds down in Florida lately watching lots of spring-trap baseball talking to players and managers you were in Clearwater one day last week what do you know about the 2017 Phillies that makes me incredibly interesting and I don't know if you went around the Dimond how many players on the 2017 Phillies","20":"Goldschmidt and his career and all the different qualities that has made him for sure it made him a star I think because the TV place for that hasn't quite happened for him yet no it away is underrated he's one of those guys I think this happens all the time and because of that the ongoing debate it is so underrated he's overweight are so overrated he's underrated the Joey Votto","23":"is overrated wow I think the phenomenon of what he was supposed to be and what he sometimes is overshadows the fact that never makes it to a full season yet he hasn't been there when they've got the October when they really needed them given day there's nobody more exciting to watch when takes the ball and Stephen","13":"a bat to unfold because they've got some incredibly important to see that they're going to have to make the next year or two and the decisions they make and how they play out will determine whether franchise go from here young prospects at catcher in the Outfield JP Crawford of course coming up at shortstop eventually any of the young guys UF especially high hopes for Scott Kingery is the second baseman the","14":"Scott Kingery is the second baseman the future now and stays Araneta to something to say about that but he certainly opened eyes Alfaro I understand he's the catcher the future and he's got work to do but nothing that anybody saw this spring change that and I think JP Crawford is learning ally life lessons a lot of baseball lessons and I think the fact is Freddy Galvis is ahead of him and","31":"you really to pick your spots to play almost purely as a DH or a bad Off the Bench that you know against right hand right-handed starting pitchers pitched unfortunately for him he reached the market at a time when teams are looking for that age of the purity is just about over can use those spots and totally different ways now and so I think just the circumstances are not right for him to play anymore","27":"up buddy you heard Dave zinkoff most iconic voices and the philadelphians ever thinking about the people I'm going to wind up being in the facility Jewish Sports Hall of Fame with and I'm not I don't have 17 different Halls of Fame that I'm a member of the Scooby-Doo the second floor by high school so incredibly an honored that this happened to me was just a hunch Jason","15":"the fact is Galvis is ahead of him and established that he's a big league player Weider in their kennel on on that team among all the Latino players means I can't take it for granted that the clothes are just going to I'm in the big leagues when they when he feels like it and I know it's going to be when he turns it important extremely talented guy who assume the","12":"they're following the Playbook I mean I guess my question about them now is I where's there Kris Bryant where is there Anthony Rizzo where is there college work and if those players are not in the big leagues or not in the system where they going to come from they've got a lot of money but the point where were really going to fight out of this regime Matt klentak and Andy macphail and and all the people
