The fruit of the spirit is right so don't want to get all geeky on here but you know if you begin to think through that does it make Great Grandma right but it's terrific theology","55":"let's see what happen is that happened a while back that happened a month ago 2 weeks ago we took that car to the junkyard and so my posture towards my son who says I'm so sorry I put this piece of gum into this car that we the junkyard makes no sense for my heart to be frustrated at my son right now I might say thank you and a half and I forgive you and that was obviously wrong because in principle it","42":"now we begin to think about this this this I want you to kind of think and come and give a mental picture of having the entire tree and if we're just to cut it right down the center all the way down so you would see what is above ground was below ground what you see is an organism that is somehow it in part of it scene and if you think about a fruit tree there's there's part of it and

not so well in in patients or self-control I'm not doing very well at that but man I am gentle and what we've been getting to miss steak is the fruit of the spirit for the fruit of our personalities and so what we begin to see is in all of this these are traits when we begin to walk by the spirit these fruits are manifested in our life everything all these traits are the fruit singular of the spirit and so we begin to miss the point and so we might see people that say oh I know this person that has this","58":"so here's what happens it says to put to death that part of the Flesh and here's what happens at flesh is that part of us that wants to be God that the gospel begins to change from the inside out and so that begins that that to mean that from under the law when we were under the law it means performance intensity this is what makes me acceptable before God in our flesh is still trying to do that and he saying crucify that you must under it's you are accepting before God to crucify that part of you who is trying to be its own God and trying to measure","66":"accepted by God and that's your identity to be able to tell my kids you're not a good person flies in the face of much of what we've seen at least popular psychology in terms of raising our kids and parenting if we tell our kids the truth and that they are inherently not good people but there are fully except did","59":"that part of you who is trying to be its own God and trying to measure up to being approved and then to being a accepted by God the splash of the is a part of you that is trying to work for God smile the flesh is that part of you that is trying to work for God's approval what happens is that flesh takes your job and it tries to make this your primary significance it will take your Cigna it'll take your your relationships and make them your eye identity and meaning you'll take your sex and make it the only way that you really feel approval take working out and it makes it feel like this is the only time that you","8":"who are you you might start off with your name you might start off of characteristics about you things you do relationships that you're in things that define your

well like I said my intentions are to date you then I asked you what was your reply to that she says well then I said well I think that I'd like just to be friends until your intentions are more than just dating I sit there and I think good luck guys rooted he's got an identity","95":"let us not people who are avoiding let's be courageous tonight as we think about this Lord I just pray that it is people are processing this lower than they would just have both courage to be able to be honest Lord I pray that spouses will have conversations if friends will ask questions and that we would walk in Freedom","57":"our acceptance not for our acceptance and so when we begin to see this what we begin to understand is that we accepted fully and completely by God John Bunyan people you should come to John but he said if you continue to tell people that they are completely accepted by God they'll do whatever they want John Bunyan said back to them if I tell people how accepted they are before Christ still do whatever he wants because we begin to work out of our acceptance not from our acceptance so here's what happens it says to put to death that part","20":"is a false gospel this false gospel always leads us to an understanding of really a bondage kind of of gospel that this is always leads us into bondage and the problem is is often times this can appear very spiritual and it can really Pierce our identities as we become followers of Christ identified in this way with these kind of list that are dictating our actions and what happens is it is we can get into bondage by this false gospel but but believe that","90":"far future there's false identities a creep into my heart there's things that I want to weave into the lives of my children there are things I want to say this is what rooted looks like resume.

Christ being found in him being fully accepted having no holes to be filled by your hobby","14":"want to get into that I want to unpack this to be able to help us to understand that how we answer the question who am I hi and how that identity fundamentally affects every single thing in our life to that I want to go to Galatians 5 Galatians 5 is is Paul's writing to this church English and Spa bet talks about what it means for people to walk in the spirit so the spirit empowers us to know and live in Jesus Christ so being a follower of Christ empowered by the Holy Spirit do you said it's better that I go and so I can give you the spirit and so there's not just one","31":"that it's not just a personality things that I did that yeah I'm I'm happy to speak my mind to say all these things but but I'm also not very gentle either when we see fruit of the spirit is not we need to work on one side of this thing that is not how this works but we begin to see the fruit of the spirit is always fully integrated together some of our personalities you know there might be some be that man that you were gentle you are kind you are at your sweet butt but when we begin to look at this this is not accompanied by moments of courage in your life either","78":"in that feels that somehow those roots begin to be wrapped around his identity in Christ and so he can without regret saying no to those things and moves to a college town on the west coast it's a job at a much smaller firm making much less money so he can help a church when in that town because he has freedom from thinking that he had to win his acceptance and who he was in his identity through money through success how to get my voice I think about","70":"and ask you out why do you think that you want to wear this that this is just what people wear come on okay well why do you think people want to wear that I don't know Dad it just it looks cool and boys notice when girls dress like this well why do you want to wear so if you didn't dress like that how how would you feel remember God notices you whether","33":"our and so what we begin to see his identity as a follower of Christ based upon a few things that we do well you know so there's nine of these and if you three you know that's your at 33% you know and play in the majors yeah that's good enough so I can I can I can look at this and I can bring you to say yeah the spirit is transformative because I'm a gentle person because I'm a patient person but what does it happen there is there's not this courageousness there's there's nothing truthfulness and when you begin to put all these two what you begin to see is it has to go together and so when we begin to think about this there's","18":"against these things there is no law so in this what we begin see things that we basically begin to kind of Orient Are view of what it means to be a follower of Christ and so we begin to say these are the don'ts these are dues is Joshua introduced earlier in the

a follower of Christ what it means for us to to be and identified a follower of","52":"I think that many of us still have this idea of trying to check off the list and this is what makes us acceptable and so in terms of who we are in terms of her identity it's still in this it's kind of vain and how we know this is sometimes it for you to think back to if you're praying to God what expression is God face towards you when you pray to him is it in different is it frowning is it disappointed when you pray what is God's posture towards you","69":"spiritual that are based upon the identity and informing the identity of Christ in your life and so we go and we shop foreclosed as a 12 year old girl and her dad and we're shopping and she picks out stuff and I begin to think about what she holding up and I think about that moment where I might not approve of what she holds up and to ask you out why do you think that you want to wear this","26":"through does it make Great Grandma right but it's terrific theology so what we begin to see is that is not the fruits of the spirit are but the fruit singular of the spirit is and it gives a list of things here and this is crucial why you need to understand this because when you begin to understand this in this terminology you begin to not live in this false gospel but you begin to live in the true gospel of grace because what we begin to see is what this looks like when we begin to have a new idea that belief people's acceptance right from the very beginning","35":"that its holistic understanding it's in its entirety we begin to take that and say this is what happens when the spirit begins to work in your life Timothy Keller said we don't see our maturity by our strengths this is this your only as mature as your weakest trait you're only as mature as your weakest trait so we think about what it means to actually follow Christ in maturity what it means walk-in him you're only as mature so the way to measure your spiritual

the visible part of our life is always connected to the root of the invisibility of Our Lives and this if the fruits are completely tied to the roots then we don't need to ask what are we rooted into verse 24 Paul goes on says this and those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh his passions and desires","44":"all that continue to produce cherries and yet what will have in this behavior modification thing is that we ignore the roots and we just try to focus on the fruits that we ignore what would it comes from it just said I'm just going to try to make something else I'm going to try to pop out this fruit and some kind of way but but the reality is the fruits of your life are always determined by The Roots I think we have that up there the fruits of your life are

there is no law the very end of that list now Paul using that one in a rhetorical way for emphasis but to as we begin to see this all put together goes back to Romans 8:1 he begins to say this","45":"either right on your palm because this is a significant principle for you to understand in your life that you should never expect fruit while it's what you've never invested into root wise and whatever is coming fruit wise is always going back to what is happening route YZ you don't do anything fruit wise it's not connected to your system to whatever your root system is wrapped around
