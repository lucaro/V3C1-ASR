A polygon this will be the low-resolution mesh and now in red we have much more polygons all right and this is the high-resolution match these faces have a normal right this is Westport sample have this normal all this plane is looking at work but this high-resolution mesh have a lot of normals write each polygon is looking in One Direction soap how does the production of the normal must work","74":"right you're going to create here and mayo image of movie","57":"this is the effect of the normal allows you to show a lot of detail that is not actually in the model what is its","20":"we are going to position it over the world because as I said","14":"and we are going to create","31":"so let's select normals tangent you should wear your friend ignore my calls and now we need to activate this option here alright we can make it for a movie Rises it means that if we have a motor with the mesh of aqueous cool dude or something we can bake it's higher level to the reason the current level right but this is not the case and we're going to bake selected to Attic So we need to select everything","78":"brightness and contrast and it seems that it has no effect on the preview for my well giving a lot of contrast to this sorry to this image we can achieve quite useful facts alright so result 4D tutorial we just cancel at this and will in just one baked navigate to Collision because we don't have more texture we could bake Shadows we could bake whatever and well I hope you learn something from this at all I hope you understood then home I'm not sure exclamation Because I think it wasn't very good and well maybe in some time I I","70":"that shows us the the places when several updates join mix together I don't know how to explain it well enough Shadow","33":"the reason we have peace Creative Kids because blender needs-based extra for rendering this Norma's to it right here we have our Norma's and","18":"our low poly object it would be a simple play","52":"selected so now we are going to sleep here if he's so he's working on the UBS and then hear the activate the color be we don't want to see if he's so you know strange texture with crazy colors we","69":"our Dexter you can see this is a black and white picture that shows us the the places","26":"here that you","35":"we have our Norma's and as you can see it has almost easy it's almost","17":"are going to our low poly object it","64":"let's go to the edit mode and creative a new texture which will be killed a o m e the Collision okay","65":"e the Collision okay and now we go out from the edit Empress bake cute undertale says that it's making the texture and we need to just wait a few more all right here we have","49":"for example and here let's go to image of movie","44":"normal so you can understand it and we are going to display it by","4":"hey there did you show me baby","37":"has almost easy it's almost blew this is because well the model that I use is almost flat and in the surfaces that","45":"it and we are going to display it by going here to","13":"match that is a brick wall and we are going to","67":"here we have our Dexter as you can see this is a black and white picture that","30":"that we want this case we are going bake Norman's and then we are going to bake I mean to Goshen so you can see the possibilities of this option allows you to to bake a lot of things even a fool ride with the reflections shadows and everything so you can have an object with a texture that seems rendered already rendered with Shadow Queen in all the effects of the final render but is just a texter so it's this this this matter is very used for you know video games and things like that. Need to have low processing Graphics right in this makes it faster right or even in a short maybe you can use this method for saving a lot of rain that I'm okay so let's select normals","47":"come here I didn't text you it and now we are going to create a map","54":"and now you can see that we almost have that detail could you tell that this are real in the Border","32":"to Attic So we need to select everything right we need to select the brakes the wallet self-pay in this case I have to have the gym for showing you that if you have a 4 sample of character with a lot of parts you can select all of them and finally select the low poly object and then press bake the reason we have peace","50":"and here let's go to image of movie Flatout normal map","77":"image of Swan ambient occlusion you be sweet forget to sign the UV and I can see already that callers all right if we disable the normal mapping you can see that is just a color it has a lot of fuses what sample we can use it in color right so it just the the the parts of the Dexter is brighter it's a you know it is brighter in the dark parts are not Brighton's have no brightness at all we can also go let me go to let me check it colors we can give you the brightness and contrast","40":"right so this wouldn't tell any speak so it","80":"tutorials and happy bending","7":"is looking up and this is looking in the Alamo write this normal Tails blender or with the software 3D that you use in this case is when their tails weather in which direction the light should reflect the surface or right so the more polygons you have the more details you have in the more the smoothies transitions hot right because here yes if you are if you have flat polygons it would be very rigid and you have the smooth polygons it will be do you smoke but it's not the same as if we have here in this corner we have a lot of polygons making it a cure write it it's much more detail okay so now I'm going to explain how are the projection of a normal Mouse work so let's say we have. A polygon this will","9":"how does the production of the normal must work well here what do you mean it will be doing it's a projecting array to the inside part of the lower resolution match okay for some for analyzing this pixel for rendering it it will project this way okay and here in the point of collision with a high-resolution mesh analyze in which direction the normal of that point is looking at Hazel is looking this way this way so in this part of the Dexter we do it with what it will do is store information about that direction and eat stores that information by using RGB colors right blue defines the depth of the earth that point in","43":"so you know there to see it back of this normal not so you can understand it and we are going to display it","60":"right almost also I should say this let's do this because I need to have this the same size because now we are going to bake the ambient occlusion another map that we can just baked is a displacement and displacement really help us to displaced polygon Cena in a match right we we will take this plane dividing a lot of times and you said that text without displacement Dexter to displace polygons so they have real detail but we are not going to do that in this entire so now we are fine again to hear and I'm going to duplicate this","34":"this to it right here we have our Norma's and as you can see it has","75":"mayo image of movie","61":"and I'm going to duplicate this model let's select all of this again and now you're going here to bake the ambient","79":"in some time I I can do this with a more complex model like a character for example for video game so you can see better what is this for real because in this case yes it makes sense to use it but it's not a very common case while I mean it's very common case but it's not awesome what's a Transformers I'll be like that for for knowing what this is useful alright so this is all for this tutorial see you soon on pewter tutorials and happy bending","38":"use is almost flat and in the surfaces that are not listen to the to the plane is where the detail is you can see that it has some green and red mixing information right so this wouldn't tell","71":"explain it well enough Shadow win schmoochle the winter is very useful for defining a lot of dates of Define volumes and this Esther I find it very useful for when texturing I take this map and I put it in Photoshop at your multiplayer mode over the rest of the layers so you have a little information about the volume of the objects and we can keep a little Shadow Queen in the dark parts of the model okay so here we are going to apply","36":"see has almost easy it's almost blew","48":"here didn't text you it and now we are going to create a map well I'm a material that it will be called best month and now we're going to Dexter's create a new one call it normal map for example and here let's go to image of","76":"image of movie Swan ambient","12":"so let's go to blender I have this model this will be our high-resolution match that is a brick wall","16":"are going to create our low poly object","62":"now you're going here to bake the ambient occlusion","21":"it over the world because as I said it we projecting the race to the inside okay so we have it here in the inside in the inside of","10":"of the earth that point in red and green defines the direction from Fort Worth to backward and from left to right so depending on the amount of each color that he did each pixel uses we will tell blender how to reflect that pixel into the Dexter so here it will stories correction the same for all the other points this procedure will be done with all pics of the Dexter to his wheel allows us to fake a lot of detail into this polygon okay and when looking it from the front okay direction we will feel that we have all these","19":"poly it would be a simple play","51":"Flatout normal map and hear an image sampling we need to activate this option because when tell blender that this map this text with this image is actually a normal map and here we can select the type of normal map it is right is what I we selected so now we are going to sleep here if","22":"we have it here in the inside in the inside of of the of the plane there's nothing so we won't have normal. So we need to put it over the original model","6":"hey there did you show me baby dad from lenses.com and today we are going to see how to create normal maps and baking textures so first of all I like to make an introduction to what Norma's are and how the procedure of projecting normal match works so you can start doing it Model S knowing what you are doing and why you are doing it so first of all we start by defining normal let's see I'd say it's hard to faces right faces each face in an in-center has a normal right this normal defines the direction in which this face is looking to I think this is looking up and this is looking in the Alamo","24":"and now would we need to do is to create you bees for this object go here","73":"so right you're going to create here and mayo","53":"know strange texture with crazy colors we need to use it as normal right here we can select the amount of it we have he even invited so you can see you can use it in Burton but we're going to Larry this one and now you can see","72":"so here we are going to apply to this to this object so you can see how it looks so here right you're going to create here","28":"that you meme H editor and if everything impressed you need to have boobies now we need to create a text you it will be no no no hey 1024 seems okay alright we have it and now we need to go to the renter panel Inn at the bottom we have reception bake okay this will bake the channel that we want in this case we are going bake","5":"hey there did you show me baby dad","23":"we need to put it over the original model and now would we need to do is to","63":"going to bake the ambient occlusion the world activate ambient occlusion we don't need to activate but just for changing key to the amount of samples right we can be activated but now when baking it it will bake it with the given samples because 5 is a very low sample rate and it will have a lot of noise I would text her so have him here we have the immigration but we need to create here let's go to the edit mode and creative","27":"here that you meme H editor","56":"let's look at matter would you tell that this is a real model this is a text feature this is the effect of the normal allows you to show a","41":"right so this wouldn't tell any speak so it will tell blender how to reflect light so you know there","15":"and we are going to create our low poly"}
