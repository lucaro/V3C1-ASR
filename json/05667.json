{"30":"cold room of Earth and the proper temperature in the soil and then natural suction in the ground past the whole filtration system in the earth emerging as a spring where the soil is at the right temperature which is also the reason there are Springs in the top of the mountains this is when water is fully matured ripe and clay this is the water you want to drink spring water a true spring","33":"water a true spring has a temperature","41":"water and glass","32":"to drink spring water a true spring has a temperature","40":"from water go to the source and find real wild water it's available everywhere in the world and if you can't go to The Source by spring water and glass","16":"keep its scent spiral movement the motion of the universe the galaxies the spiral is seen throughout nature as the growth movement from seashells pine","11":"H2O however water is much more than that water is made of billions of hydrogen bond between water molecules that form hexagons when we are looking for a drinking is structured water just like Honey Combs are made of a lot of Oregon's water consists of a giant network of hydrogen bonds forming a liquid Crystal it is this fluid and moving","21":"rises cools and condenses then form clouds and Falls as rain when the rain hits a cool forested area most of it it's drawn into the cooler Earth Chardon groundwater and aquifers and Sons rains away over the surface eventually evaporating and beginning the cycle again what I want to stress is that the forest of ground is cooler and the infiltration of water keeps the water table High","39":"from plastic water go to the source and find","7":"the chicken-and-egg","9":"remember that when you drink water it instantly becomes your blood you got to build your blood out of the best water possible don't you agree do you have any clue where you're building your blood from is the best water bottle water in plastic is it tap water full of chlorine and fluoride like our skeleton that is made out of Bones and provides our body with structural support","25":"continually drinking distilled water has been shown to cause the body to stripped of trace minerals and other elements another option is to drink surface water from Dan's reservoirs or large rivers are those contain some minerals and salts accumulated by contact with the soil but generally speaking it is not very good quality water mostly because of its exponent you're too heavy oxygenation and to heat from the Sun","10":"made out Bones and provides our body with structural support water structural component the famous H2O however water is","26":"exponent you're too heavy oxygenation and to heat from the Sun the heat removes a great deal of its water structure living as with the last part of the Hide logical cycle with groundwater water that has infiltrated the cool Earth there are three types of groundwater the first rc Springs water that has infiltrated and hit an impervious stratton's of the earth and had its cycle within the Earth","29":"also problems what are high in TDS total dissolved solids has too many in organic minerals dissolved into it like calcium mineral water is not yet the best water occasionally it's fine to drink it just hasn't matured because it was dug up before closing its cycle the true best water comes after it has passed the deep dark and cold room of the Earth and the proper temperature in the soil and then","34":"water a true spring has a temperature close to 4 degrees Celsius and it Shimmers Tris pranks from the creeks in the forest it's six the shade of trees to maintain a structure and cold temperature as it spirals down them out spring water is the water you want to drink and build your blood out of not bottled water in containers that have been transported trucks and planes","35":"in containers that have been transported trucks and planes spending a lot of time Under the Sun and set in store shelves for who-knows-how-long being struck down by all kinds of light for me rustic tea because of that point is basically just water infused with","19":"possible heat where do we find water that has moved in Spirals and it","17":"throughout as the growth movement from seashells pine cones to animal horns it's everywhere our DNA is a spiral it is the movement of last possible freak of last possible heat where do we find water that","42":"glass","8":"the chicken-and-egg question how much more fundamental one is what came before life or water water present itself in three forms in the world as water as sap and as blood water is the basis of life on Earth it is the blood of the earth sap is the blood of plants just like blood in animals remember that when you drink water it","22":"and the infiltration of water keeps the water table High what happens to the cycle if the forest is Renee what are still evaporates Rises cools condenses and Falls as rain but once the forest is removed the exposed ground he rapidly and it is hotter than the incident rain making it impossible for the rainwater to infiltrate without absorption more water runs off in the sea just","24":"in for drinking the long-term rain water has evaporated and condensed and it has a similar aspect of pure distilled water pure H2O no minerals or elements are present in it rain water is water as a child it desperately pulls things to it it feeds off whatever it's around itself it has not yet matured and it's very hungry from minerals continually drinking distilled water has been shown to","37":"away from plastic water go to the source","28":"Earth the next type of groundwater comes after water has seeped into the Earth and it is in the lower levels of the soil what is called a hard water or a mineral water mineral water usually has been reached by Danielle well deep into the ground and was pumped up to the surface something that involves a lot of pressure and heat which is bad avoided long-term drinking of mineral water can also cause problems what are high in TDS total","38":"from plastic water go to the source and find","20":"do we find water that has moved in Spirals and it is cold to answer that look into its cycle in the planet water is an organism that has a life cycle from birth through maturation and death What's called the hydrological here we're looking at a highly forested area water evaporates from the tree leaves and from the ocean it rises cools and condenses then","23":"absorption more water runs off in the sea just creating floods what is really more alarming than anything is that the ground water table sinks and it's Supply csis where is the best water to drink within this cycle is it rain water while rain water is the purest naturally available putting atmospheric pollutants aside of course rainwaters in suitable for drinking the long-term rain water has evaporated","13":"just we humans have a specific body temperature water has a body temperature of 4 degrees C and wants to keep it self the closest possible so we can be at its best when water is cold and structured it has a much greater energy potential what destroys water structure to keep its temperature water must be kept away from heat light and oxygen and water","14":"heat light and oxygen and water must keep its natural scent spiral movement","31":"you to drink spring water a true spring","27":"stratton's of the earth and had its cycle within the Earth stopped and never got to go to the older layers of the ground it hasn't been fully filtrated and cleaned this water is fine to drink is it just not optimal it hasn't matured enough in the Earth the next type of groundwater comes after water has","36":"that point is basically just water infused with plastic plastic substances that act as xenoestrogens all kinds of havoc in the hormone system of the body stay away from plastic water go to the","15":"keep its natural scent spiral movement","12":"a Crystal it is this fluid and moving structure that gives its unique properties but this is only the skeleton of water as the universal solvent water Bonds in the middle of hacks all kinds of minerals creating different characteristics to itself no water is
