{"288":"okay it's waiting","306":"it was or 900 but you can definitely","11":"battery it's powering both the camera and the slider and this is the nmx controller right the here this is what sort of sense the controls to the motors got a motor that are there and also there","134":"and we just go ahead and check to see if I like that choke on it it's all right","158":"start so I'm just going to set my starting point now I'm going to go and I'm going to work on","160":"go I'm going to work on the ending point so they come back over here","215":"just trying to get a test to hear","29":"that a little cloudy and again main thing here is","131":"there and then we just go ahead and check to see if","249":"ahead and the motors to start","207":"and that really didn't work I'm at moving very very slowly what you really want to focus","300":"shots got about three shots there that's about right so looks like we're","173":"up your exposure time your buffer you interval the key trick here is that you want to make sure that your interval was pretty low","289":"okay waiting and we'll go ahead and look at our exposures here we're at to 8 we'll just over goes on a little bit I'm about there and I here and","74":"the unit and what you want to look for","201":"about 3 hours and I just adjusted the the","176":"want to sure that your interval was pretty low so I was it was explained to me","57":"reading it it seems that little gearbox or the first thing we you got to do if we","31":"you try that again and see what I'll do is I","285":"up here first so that's what we'll do go ahead and","70":"okay and then I'm going to come over here","33":"try that again and see what I'll do is I got power to the unit I'm","252":"well that's moving we're ready to","114":"XY up there because your your pan and tilt like a little virtual Joi we'll see if","165":"bit you spell check it out","96":"aux to Port here we go","133":"and we just go ahead and check to see if I","49":"she was a cup that out there we go","84":"means that it's inside so we have that","230":"and she would get 800 810 and we'll go to next all right this is where you can program your ramp and ramp","117":"Joi we'll see if this is what I'm working for","93":"want to go ahead put that in TV aux to Port here we go","284":"set up here first so that's what we'll do go","50":"she was a cup that out there we go okay you can see here that the","77":"and what you want to look for is these two","80":"these two lights and when you have the","248":"we'll go ahead and send the motors to start","227":"into my frame and we'll just make that 800 Ashley pretty","188":"on your view as well as the interval you want","132":"and then we just go ahead and check to see if I","195":"another mistake that I made was focusing on the video baby you know I should go out","157":"ahead and hit that should sex start so I'm just going to set my starting point","264":"there today we can get out of there I think that's ready to the start so other chip I think","231":"where you can program your ramp and ramp","221":"someone have to say about 800 so I'm going to come into my","153":"the and we have a start button","217":"just trying to get a test to hear someone have to","79":"for is these two bottom lights and when you have the","302":"right so looks like we're all","71":"okay and then I'm going to come over here to the","120":"see if this what I'm working for us","154":"have a start button","225":"800 so I'm going to come into my frame and we'll just","76":"and what you want to look for","184":"so you'll need to really take into consideration the interval on your view as","224":"800 so I'm going to come into my frame and","167":"it out okay now I'm going to","213":"on is your so figure out","204":"and just adjusted the the shots and things like that to get me a 3-hour move and that really didn't work","122":"it's pretty good there","143":"the Tilted Kilt","62":"first thing we you got to do if we have to come over here and we've got","107":"let's get a Move It Go","169":"okay now I'm going to set the","287":"the okay it's waiting","21":"the end of Max the power that slide so you sort of known as","10":"really just here for the moment I've got to Kessler battery and it's powering both the camera","102":"okay","180":"me I've got an interval said here at two seconds","294":"sugaring let's go see if we were calculating the shots got","162":"you need to slide it over video about right there's good we will just start at the Goodwill planet that way a little bit you spell check it out","129":"like there and then we just","280":"start your set up","88":"we have well I'm here I want to go ahead and","240":"everything really really basic just want to straighten move","260":"before we do that we got to go shut the view up and he's pranking will go up to you medicine I don't know if you can focus on this or not babe go to time lapse if the time-lapse mode what do auto ramping that's what we want here","251":"the motors to start and there we go coming around well that's moving we're","261":"what do auto ramping that's what we want here interval mode Auto variable we also have external ox2 I've been learned is it that's really when you're looking for a signal being sent from some other device to trigger the of you","149":"close for government work the cast and we have a","5":"guess it might be the right word for those of you that have used ATV 3 you know it can get a little bulky and boxy so liking this unit set up","63":"you got to do if we have to come over here and we've got to put this thing","41":"and I go ahead and program the","15":"the other ones or the power to your tilt so you have that and this kid right here two and a half no","245":"learn that stuff they're not to visit tutorial but it's really more of a test","148":"close for government work the cast and","210":"very very slowly what you really want to focus on is your shots so","55":"and it's reading it it seems that little gearbox or the first thing we you got","66":"we have to over here and we've got to put this thing in a slave mode C slave mode","239":"screen I'm just everything really really basic just want to straighten move","155":"have a start button go ahead","150":"work the cast and we have a start button","209":"at moving very very slowly what you really want to focus on is your shots","296":"the shots got about three","95":"that in aux to Port here we go","139":"it's all right","236":"and ramp out with the screen I'm just keeping everything really really","90":"well I'm here I want to go ahead and","111":"has your XY up there because your","14":"for the the X and the Y ones for the rotation the other ones or the power to your tilt so","175":"that you want to make sure that your interval was pretty low so I was it was","205":"things like to get me a 3-hour move and that really didn't work I'm at moving very very slowly what you","253":"well that's moving we're ready to start the","256":"well that's moving we're ready to start the program so before we do that we got to go shut the","258":"the program before we do that we got to go shut the view up","212":"on is your shots so figure","200":"about 3 hours and I just adjusted the the","308":"or 900 but you can definitely see that we've had a lot of movement started there and we're now here and it's still going probably just has a little bit more so successful test pretty excited about that and we'll call it a night thank you","265":"start so other chip I think again","269":"other chip I think again I don't know if it's Acura knock and someone had said","282":"set up here first","135":"choke on it it's all right","125":"there coming to here","172":"now I'm going to set the the in here what's a set in game I hit the next button so this is a really important screen here this is where your setting up your exposure time your buffer you interval","146":"Tilted Kilt angry Hugo shut that down a little alright","130":"like there and then we just go ahead and","17":"right here and a half no male to male sort of how we're going to get the signal out of the","65":"we have to come over here and we've got to put this thing in a slave mode","202":"about 3 and I just adjusted the the shots","44":"ahead and program the","250":"the motors to start","37":"on the dynamic perception app and","192":"want to sit here so two seconds is actually pretty good feel good without that that the other thing is","110":"is the first screen has your XY up there because","127":"to here","13":"for the the X and the Y ones","270":"other chip I think again I don't know if it's Acura knock and someone had said that you","99":"here we go","137":"it it's all right","141":"all right the Tilted","105":"okay let's get a Move","30":"a cloudy and again main thing here is just to test it been having a little challenges been going to the comedian Facebook getting some chips and the tricks you try that again and see what I'll do is","1":"okay","47":"the the move that we want to make","216":"just trying to get a test to hear someone","226":"I'm going come into my frame and we'll just","214":"figure out 10 seconds we got 6 shots and minute 16 X-360 figure 3 hours so I don't know that Steve just under a thousand maybe so we can go on another puppy extend out of maybe we go 800,000 just trying to get a test to hear","307":"was or 900 but you can definitely see","91":"well I'm here I want to go ahead and put that in TV aux","43":"go ahead and program the","9":"ship larger L bracket so you have plenty of room I'm using really right just here for the moment I've got to Kessler","128":"to here and you can explain to you that you got just a little bit like right there and then we just","203":"3 and I just adjusted the the shots and","147":"that a little alright close enough for government work the cast","104":"okay let's","244":"straighten plenty of tutorials on the end of Max so you can learn all that stuff they're not to visit tutorial but it's really","273":"I don't know it's Acura knock and someone had said that you should start","183":"said here two seconds Guinness what it was supposed to mean was it that means that as soon as the nmx receives a signal from The View wait about 2 seconds before starting next move so you'll need to really take into consideration the interval on your","103":"okay let's","152":"the and we have a start button","38":"perception app and I will go ahead and","118":"we'll see if this is what I'm working for us","48":"the move that we want to make she was a cup that out there we go","100":"here go","81":"two lights and when you have the light on the right along with the light on the left both lit that means that it's inside","140":"it's all right the","291":"sugaring let's go see if we were","196":"focusing on the video baby you know I should go out tonight","19":"going to get the signal out of the view into the end of Max the","268":"other chip I think again I don't know if it's","281":"start your set up here first","51":"okay you can see here that the intervalometer is coming up","243":"want to straighten move plenty of tutorials on the end of Max so you can","191":"as interval you want to sit here so two seconds is actually pretty good","177":"that your was pretty low so I was it was explained to me","277":"someone had said that you should start your","123":"it's pretty there","255":"well that's moving we're ready to start the program so","163":"that way a little bit you spell check it out","276":"knock someone had said that you should start your","301":"there that's about right so looks like we're","108":"a It Go","164":"little bit you spell check it out","2":"okay well here when I try a second test with the","89":"well I'm here I want to go ahead and","241":"everything really basic just want to straighten move plenty of","197":"on video baby you know I should go out tonight","136":"choke on it it's all right","151":"the cast and we have a start button","144":"the Tilted Kilt","142":"the Tilted Kilt","283":"set up here first so that's what we'll do","78":"and you want to look for is these two bottom lights","159":"my starting point now I'm going to go and I'm going to work on the ending point so they come back over here","112":"has your XY up there because your your pan and","106":"let's get a Move It","121":"see if this what I'm working for us and you can see the unit it's definitely moving it's a good thing just like that over hey the starting point to do a left-to-right then move here yeah it's pretty good there","109":"a It Go and this is the first screen has your XY up","182":"interval said here two seconds","26":"to go from day tonight we're going to try that here a little cloudy","279":"that should start your","298":"the shots got about three shots there that's about","138":"it's all right","4":"the perception it's a stage one I'm using a sapphire Pro unit Manitou a stage one here Saffire Pro sort of like a Irmo TV3 does pan and tilt I will say I'm really happy with it super lightweight very low profile I guess it might be the right word for those of you that have used","292":"sugaring let's go see if we were","235":"and ramp out with the screen I'm just keeping everything","168":"okay now I'm going to set","94":"that in aux to Port here we go","290":"here and we'll start it alright you got my trigger sugaring let's go see if we were","115":"like a little virtual Joi we'll see if this is what I'm","54":"is up Big Ed's time lapse so we're going to slide that to 2 on and it's reading it it seems that little gearbox or the first thing we","40":"and I will go ahead and program the","101":"go okay","211":"want to on is your shots so figure","171":"okay now I'm going to set the the in here","60":"or the first thing we you got to do if we have to come over here","34":"and see what I'll do is I got power to the unit I'm going to go","299":"shots got about three shots there that's about right","178":"was pretty low so I was it was explained to me I've got an interval said here at two seconds","198":"on video baby you know I should go out tonight maybe about 3 hours and I just adjusted","238":"the screen I'm just keeping everything really really basic just want to straighten move","272":"again I don't know if it's Acura knock and someone had said that you should start","113":"your XY up there because your your pan and tilt like a","293":"sugaring let's go see if we were","295":"if we were the shots got about","12":"got a motor that there and also there if you look at these three lights in these cables ones for the the X and the Y","242":"really basic just want to straighten move plenty of tutorials on the end of","189":"your view as well as the interval you want to sit here","246":"that stuff not to visit tutorial but it's really more of a test into Spelman it see if I catch any errors we'll go ahead and send the motors","16":"kid right here and a half no male","297":"the shots got about three shots","208":"really didn't work I'm at moving very very slowly what you really want to focus on is your","274":"know it's Acura knock and someone had said that you should start","262":"when you're looking a signal being sent from some other device to trigger the of you so we're going to be moved out to Auto variable had a interval 10 seconds night interval 30 seconds okay destination camera that means that basically the image will be stored in the camera the XMP file which has your adjustment so you want to transfer that to the SD card at the end of your shoe will look at the ramp in options 9","92":"I want to go ahead and put that in TV aux to Port","72":"and then I'm going to come over here to the","28":"try that a little cloudy and again","97":"aux to here we go","68":"we've got to put this thing in a slave mode C slave mode it's right down at the bottom just going to toggle that over so that's your slave mode ahead okay","124":"it's pretty there coming to","267":"other chip I think again I don't know if it's","275":"Acura knock someone had said that you should start","39":"and I will go ahead and","46":"program the the","85":"means that it's inside so we have that","170":"okay now I'm going to set the","25":"as a people to go from day tonight we're going to try that here a little cloudy","42":"and I go ahead and program the","181":"interval said here two seconds","58":"seems that gearbox or the first thing we you got to do if we have to","193":"feel good that that the other thing is another mistake that I made was focusing","59":"that gearbox or the first thing we you got to do if we have to come over here","8":"from the camera USB out the cameras are a little tight connection of the guys at the mnemic reception actually do ship or larger L bracket so you have plenty","199":"maybe about 3 hours and I just adjusted the","254":"well that's moving we're ready to start the","247":"see if catch any errors we'll go ahead and send the motors to start","185":"really take into the interval on your view as well","20":"get the out of the view into the end of Max the power that slide so you sort of","194":"is another mistake that I made was focusing on","52":"here that intervalometer is coming up Big Ed's","18":"male sort of how we're going to get the signal out of the view into the end of Max","233":"program your ramp and ramp out with the","266":"start so other chip I think again I don't","234":"and ramp out with the screen I'm just keeping everything","69":"going toggle that over so that's your slave mode ahead okay and then I'm going to come over here","232":"where you can program your ramp and ramp out","219":"just trying to get a test to hear someone have to say about","223":"to say about 800 so I'm going to come into my frame","166":"you spell check it out","278":"had said that you should start your","187":"the interval on your view as well as the interval","35":"and see what I'll do is I got power to the unit I'm going to go ahead and turn on the dynamic perception app","83":"lit means that it's inside so we have that","64":"do if we have to come over here and we've got to put this thing in a","286":"here first so that's what we'll do go ahead and we'll start the program okay it's waiting","257":"we're ready to the program so before we do that we got to go shut the view up","220":"trying to get a test to hear someone have to say about 800 so I'm going","145":"Tilted Kilt","259":"program before we do that we got to go shut the view up","263":"look at the ramp in options 9 probably let's just go we'll just make that new stops there well actually maybe negative you got some lucky likes ice o mat shutter Grace printers you can be there today so we can get out of there","45":"and program the","86":"inside so we have that well I'm","67":"we've got to put this thing in a slave mode C slave mode","126":"to here","206":"and that really didn't work I'm at moving very very slowly what you really want to","32":"you try that again and see what I'll do is I got power to the","229":"800 Ashley pretty good and she would get 800 810","190":"well as the interval you want to sit here so","303":"so looks like we're all","82":"with the light on the left both lit that means that it's inside so we have that","7":"from the camera USB out the","75":"the unit and what you want to look for","228":"800 Ashley pretty good","87":"we have that well I'm here","237":"ramp with the screen I'm just keeping everything really really basic just want to straighten","179":"explained to me I've got an interval said here at two seconds","3":"well here when I try a second test with the dynamic perception it's a stage one","61":"the first thing we you got to do if we have to come over here","36":"unit I'm going go ahead and turn on the dynamic perception app","98":"to here we go","304":"so looks like we're all set here alright so we'll come back and we'll see how it is later in the evening and will sign off for now okay","174":"here is that you want to make sure that your interval was pretty low","161":"I'm going to work the ending point so they come back over here and we'll go ahead and move it you want to do a better job if your cables Dynamic perception gives you a couple of cable ties you can really tighten up are you kidding and this is just for a test so I just wanted to really just make sure I get everything working you need to slide","186":"take into the interval on your view as well as","22":"Max power that slide so you sort of known as a","6":"this unit set up here got a time-lapse view inter kilometer I'm attached to a Canon 5D Mark 3 we got a USB out coming from the camera USB out","24":"power that slide so you sort of known as a ramper people to go from day tonight we're going to","73":"and then I'm going to come over here to the unit and what you want to","119":"see if this is what I'm working for us","156":"start button go ahead and hit that should sex start so I'm just","222":"someone to say about 800 so I'm going to come into my frame","53":"is coming up Big Ed's time lapse so we're going to slide that to","116":"Joi we'll see if this is what I'm working","271":"again I don't know if it's Acura knock and someone had said that you","23":"power that slide so you sort of known as a ramper","305":"sign off for now okay we're out here probably about three and a half hours or so and there's about seven hundred and 44 shot shots here can't remember how many I said it was 800 or 900 but you can","27":"to go from day tonight we're going to try that here a little cloudy and again","218":"just trying to get a test to hear someone have to say","56":"and reading it it seems that little gearbox or the first thing we you got to do"}
