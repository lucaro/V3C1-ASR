they are editing I see an interesting pattern everything that is Orange is births and everything that is sort of this dark green is deaths so this person is going day by day month by month year by year adding births and deaths to Wikipedia so they're keeping up the sort of count on what notable people have","28":"the real things is cats so let's look at cats a lot more people interested in send design rate and it's a much longer Article 2 I can scroll down here forever but then interesting things start to happen I can see like this stripey pattern here and what happened there is that someone at a table if you look at where my cursor is poi","97":"the patterns just going crazy so what's going","68":"history is very different so at top here this would have","124":"zoom out let's to see what else is in the English language what are the things that we talked about","39":"now let me show you one of our favorite","46":"the patterns that we are covered by you know thinking about visualize visualizing this sort of law he's really long files another thing we did with the same visualization is to sort of disregard authorship who was writing what and just look at","85":"his Berkeley","170":"these data sets the word tree is a very polite Axel visualization in the sense that it takes the words it doesn't reorder them it keeps them all sort of neatly organized as the author intended but you could wonder what if you were more violent with attacks and wanted to rearrange it and thought what if what you wanted to do is figure out some way to create an atlas of a text many different maps of the concepts that are I'd like to show","25":"look history in action so even though it's a little dark there this is the diagram of the evolution of the article on design and you can see that the text of the article is here on the right on the right here are the number of people to different people who have touched this I have also this one that I can bring back and I can travel through each one of these versions","42":"pages which is chocolate very pink but there isn't so far anything jumping out except that I'm visualizing this over real time so now let me do it by versions I got this interesting zig-zag when I got this I told Martin I wanted this car that looked like this but this anyway guess what's Happening Here","181":"and the son named his son after his father and so if you have things going that way again sticking with the Bible if you do pics of why and you do the Old Testament versus the New Testament you got things like children of Israel king of Israel versus the sound of the kingdom of God and then","58":"information is there any signal left mapping to understand what articles people are touching the title of the article is what we're going to use to color things so","193":"know is that important you can obviously try to make it I thought that it's not super interesting finally we hit on the idea of actually using images of the body parts themselves and discovered that attacked when you do that","59":"color things so let's look at what this looks","199":"book talks so this is what we did as you can tell by now one of our favorites I didn't Prejudice so what you're looking at here is an image of imagine that if you will and the entire book but we are only showing you the times when the book talks about a part of the body so you just read it from left to right just like you would a normal book and that's you can start to see things like there a lot of","185":"should become a wife if you can being a bride is not it is not a good deal there's a lot of","20":"article on Wikipedia you have a full edit history available publicly you have the names of people who touched each version you have the actual text of the version you have timestamps of the version and we decided okay with this is enough that we can plunge right in we quickly discovered it sort of a tall order to read you know a hundred virgins same article so okay visualization to the rescue we created a","194":"parts themselves and discovered that attacked when you do that thing popping out much more it so this is folk music if it's sort of like a poor a portrait of a very gentle genre what genre is let's see Blues how about it's also very very gentle the knees are figuring more prominently on maybe people are down on their knees I don't know there are what about heavy metal","52":"ends and we cited to start visualizing individual ones other histories and that turned out to be ultimately a portrait of obsession","18":"set out to his life pedia back then we do what we like to do is start with a mystery or a puzzle and we were puzzled by Wikipedia in 2003 it was a bit of a mystery object you know they were actually very good articles appearing but back then the whole idea of crowdsourcing or letting you know the gates open to uncredentialed people if you have a strange in the encyclopedia world we wanted to study why it worked and so luckily","69":"history is very different so at top here this would have bluish tone is all about the article called October K the one here that sort of turquoise is all November so November different days November 25th 26th 28th and so forth and then we going to December you've now by now. know what the what the what the algorithm is and then the great here is all the year so

one soccer places singing song lyrics and at one point became fascinated by lyrics and we started looking at them and thinking about lenses with which we could look at these lyrics on one idea","35":"Wikipedia this called a mass deletion but one of the things we did not know until we started visualizing these articles was that for something like this the domestication happened here at the bottom I have a timestamp you can't see but I will tell you it happen on the 17th of December at 4:06 this got fixed on the same day at 4:07 so it","83":"is were drain pressed when we saw this","64":"that we had never heard of but as a Wikipedia you have to be very diverse and so you get a sense of this person is giving themselves as a project right I can also why is this is a wall instead of","145":"size these by frequency we got a sort of more boring and it's her turn. We don't talk about colorful things that off and we use words like thing you know time and so forth but this what's a start to make these comparisons on okay time is huge compared that for the entire section of plants most of which are boring we just Bush and tree you're pretty much we spend as much time using the word time","45":"for chocolate Coolidge fines Boyer removing reverting Peter humbug out reverting and so on and so forth until Daniel saboya sort of gives up and says I don't care what you said because Martin and I did a search for chocolate collage and it seems to exist after all

different admin someone who actually has an IP address and their edit history is very very different so at top here this would","126":"look at some pasta there's 22 words that you're there's rigatoni there's ravioli there spaghetti into the sauce is getting into the the image there if we go by frequency really","206":"be done by man and as you can see by how explicit these parts are you could you imagine some of the things they're talking about if I highlight a different a different part of this there's a lot of lips going on here at Lipson and and and this is all about oral sex now I find it

is","190":"as in ZZ Top and you know it be taken to sort of ridiculous if your AC DC or you can really start using some absolutely preposterous if you're set Black Eyed Peas but no matter how it sits

we kept seeing where like things would get fixed in minutes where we actually talked to Wikipedia we asked them how are you doing this and then explain to us that there's something called a watch list which means that whenever it you edit an article you may want to add that are go to your watchlist so that you get","98":"the patterns just going crazy so what's going","174":"you add that the graph

to brightness the third desaturation for numbers were going to go little bit crazy and not do what color will just do grayscale or the dark just told us the first digit that's it so we're throwing
