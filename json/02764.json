{"2":"what's what are the","11":"so the next one we have is form formulates to three-dimensionality of a shape or an object and so in this example I have refused to airbrush to shade some of this and kind of distorted a little bit to make it look like it has a form like maybe it's three dimensional plastic form works together with shape but","39":"be monochromatic he's value I'm in a lot of different ways to change your color Charter to establish your form or even texture so how is very important it also really establishes contrast and you need contrast in a piece Fritz really stand out and for people to be able to see things clearly so an example of value is this","46":"let's take a look at an example of line as our last example of painting I did in 2011 and I'm really count turning on lines and brush Strokes in this primarily secondarily maybe color and then third is texture but it's just a bunch of lines and then sounds really fundamental but when you look at it it kind of looks like maybe it's a really close up of some wolf and fabric are some natural fiber you know","25":"to show you an example of shape we have this piece I did hear I did this one also last year and you can see it doesn't really have any form to it as far as three dimensional shading goes but there is form implied by using shapes on top of shapes or intersecting shapes or cutting shapes out of each other there's a lot of three dimensional depth without anything really being actually three-dimensional it's all kind of two-dimensional","29":"right now rather value so color seems pretty easy right you just pick a color well you want to think more about that you want to pick colors that harmonize with each other that look good when they're next to each other are grouped together so I have a video on color theory that you can watch that'll give you some more insight into that but basically you want to use colors that are harmonious so for instance this yellow here is the complementary color of","8":"do it without going into too much detail you can use the custom sponge to throw on some texture or you can even use the square chalk brush along with a paper towel sure here to paint and some texture you can watch my video on text to learn more about how to do this in more detail","20":"them so take a look at space here's that painting I did last year of a peacock Scott the body of the peacock taking up the positives and the negative space is taken up by the tail and the rest of the composition furthermore I use the rule of thirds how to divide the canvas into","14":"with to establish this form so notice that some of these go together form works with shape and color and value so that a lot of these are interchangeable with each other somewhere depending on each other let's take a look at an example of form here I have another painting that I did in 2012 and we have the spherical shape","31":"and this aqua color the colors important than how you use it's very important you don't want to just throw down colors me to randomly see what your artwork to look good 7 example of color would be this","33":"gray kind of on this Aqua kind of green tent and when I mentioned sorry about the complementary colors we have this magenta here opposite from it is aqua and so it's kind of happening is were kind of almost perceiving this gray as being some color here with a little bit of the opposite complementary color influenced in it so I know if you can see it in this example cuz there's some other colors","18":"so there's levels of space here space is generally almost always used in your artwork because you know you either have fill the page or not fill the page so you're going to be using space no matter what whether intentionally or unintentionally is generally used for composition in this case for this diagram I made it here I've used space I have everything kind of more or less you know centered and there's a certain amount of space between","52":"positioned have a video on composition you can watch coming up soon that I'll help you with the 4/3 and spatial relations and all that stuff so have fun applying this to your digital artwork I encourage you to experiment with all of these thanks for watching","26":"anything being actually three-dimensional it's all kind of two-dimensional shapes I don't know what this is I can't begin to try but it just kind of an abstract piece I did I just kind of start doodling and you not sweat it ended up as it's a really good use of space and you can also see as I'm in earlier I used some of the other elements in conjunction with shave I use texture here on this background and the whole thing kind of has a texture to it","35":"and you can that it's just a neutral gray but with all this other magenta around it it looks a little different do a couple of other colors in here like this blue just for fun and over here actually did shift the color perceptually towards the screen that I was King about so it's kind of interesting what I see here this color I also kind of sea over in all of the other Grey's to so just got to wait to mess with people's","17":"and space can be pause space or negative space this would be positive space and outside of that would be negative space so in this example of space there's different levels of space there's this area outside there's the white area surrounding it and then there is the negative space inside so there's three levels of space here space is generally","49":"there's some stuff there I guess there's in a way a form implied by the lattice makes kind of a bulging grid so maybe this does have everything but it's interesting to look at your work and see what you've used in what you having and again as I mentioned something that you have to use so you have to think about you don't have to have this list next to you and check them off one-by-one and go you know","44":"of making things out there getting from the Forum so what you want sometimes is a good balance of form and line and if you have too much for him and not enough lying the artwork might not look as good and same goes the other way around if you have too much wine in omniform and after it works just a bunch of Senseless spaghetti am I not really look that good but he even this is a form","4":"are form space shape color value in line and most artwork contains one or more of these elements usually more than one most artists use them unintentionally but you can I'm intentionally as well just to make your artwork more appealing to people who are going to look at it so I'm going to show you some different examples of how I","37":"so moving on","45":"I not really look that good but he even this is a form so sometimes there's no way no way of getting out of making more elements in art than you intend to make the kind of just happen that's the cool thing about him that what that's what makes them the fundamental elements of art so let's take a look at an example of line as our last","13":"primitive shapes so often times when you're drawing you'll use primitive shapes to build up your form and if you're driving ahead in the neck and then a torso shoulders and so on do using form to establish that oh you're also using color and value along with shape to establish this form so notice that some of these","30":"this yellow here is the complementary color of this blue down here at the bottom so if you use these two together it's going to make your artwork look really interesting I'll do it for you as an example here these two colors go when I sleep whether you can say the same for magenta and this aqua color","47":"wolf and are some natural fiber you know in biology you know collagen or something weird so it's really you know this is mostly lions but it looks really cool and again as I mentioned earlier most of these paintings if not all of them have more than one or a lot of the elements of","32":"7 example of color would be this this is just a big mess I don't know what it's supposed to be I'm just kind of playing around with color sick sample here so what I was most interested in is how this gray perceptually changes when it's surrounded by all of the magenta here's the magenta so bright and overwhelming that when the graves next to it the gray kind of takes on this Aqua","50":"and them off one-by-one and go you know okay that please","40":"clearly an example of value is this piece here but I may need to last 2012 and you can see it doesn't have a whole lot of you going on there's only one he was kind of Sauron jello with you and that doesn't change your lie or the only thing that changes is the value so we have a dark Hue here and then we sample around we can see clearly just moving lighter and darker in value it's the","7":"on canvas there's lots of ways to use texture texture and really make something look like it exists and it's an environment in an environment and it's real and it's especially good to use if you're doing digital art because it's going to make your artwork look physical so texture is really easy to use and painter couple of the ways really quickly to do it without going into too much detail you can use the custom sponge","9":"to do this in detail what's an example of texture from one of the paintings I did in 2012 you can see in this painting I used a lot of texture in this piece All Along The Wall here and on the ground especially I want to look like there's you know a lot of just little bits of rocks and gravel and things and then it works really well too on the","43":"finally we have line and line can be just a bunch of lines you know you can draw a bunch of spaghetti and that could be your artwork or you can use lines to enhance your forms which is what I'm doing here so these lines are kind of just following Contours and kind of making things stick out there getting from the Forum","34":"I know if you can see it in this example cuz there's some other colors going on here but if you were to cover up part of the screen and only look at Justin will Ariat little area here this gray and some of these Grey's might look like they're kind of tinted towards screen a little bit like they're not actually pure Gray see that by sampling these colors here I'm sampling this gray here and you can see that it's just a neutral gray but with all this other","3":"what's what are the elements of art and how we can use these principles to create more interesting digital artwork so the elements of art are the fundamental components of a or an illustration or even at like a sculpture any kind of art that's visual art 7 comments are texture form space","38":"moving on from color will go to Value next and value is essentially the percentage of lightness or darkness that something has so white to black and everything in the middle doesn't necessarily have to be just black and it could be dark blue or light blue to be monochromatic he's","36":"in all of the Grey's to so just got to wait to mess with people's heads when they looking at your art you can use color to do that and this piece really only focuses on color I wasn't trying to send you the other elements here even though I did unintentionally there's some spatial relations between the gray and there's some line and there's some texture and things so","48":"than one or a lot of the elements of art that I described so this has texture and color and value space and it's got pretty much everything to it doesn't really have a whole lot of form really because everything so the screen and I didn't really do a whole lot of three dimensional shading but there's there's some stuff there I guess there's in a way a form","12":"plastic form works together with shape but again for me smarty three-dimensionality form is a combination of primitive shapes generally so in this example this F is ASL April shape combined with a couple more cylindrical shapes though is just a Taurus and then the same thing with the rest of the other shapes here they're just combination primitive shapes so often times","16":"when I was driving it and then goes with the body down here and it's a lot of form implied in this painting here and getting it right really makes or breaks the peace, as far as trying to translate this really simple message here next we will move on to space and space can be pause space or","21":"how to divide the canvas into equal segments and you can see that running down the center to words that's where I placed the peacock's body and then everything else takes up the rest so so multiple uses of space here this painting","10":"things then it works really well too on the closing here where I put this brown texture that looks like dirt and it makes it look really weathered and really used if I hadn't done that you might really get the point of this painting you know that the person's not really in a very good condition here so","19":"know centered and there's a certain amount of space between every I just kind of did this you know naturally however I feel like doing and I didn't have to know read me instructions on how to space things I just kind of did it this way can you help me do a lot of these things naturally but it's just nice to know if they're there if you weren't aware of them so take a look at space","51":"off one-by-one go you know okay that please text her okay good and then I use for him right and I have to worry about that just do it automatically and then if you need some inspiration now and then and you don't know where to start on something think about one of these Concepts you know that start with that space is generally the easiest to start with and just figure out where everything going to be positioned","6":"implying kind of ammo will texture and even though it doesn't really physically have a texture cuz it's just on my screen however it looks like it has a texture texture could also be an actual physical texture you could have you know the texture of clay if you have a sculpture or you have the texture of oil painting canvas if you do if you know traditional paintings on canvas there's lots of ways to use texture","24":"you were to fill it in make it look three-dimensional than that would be for so they are kind of interchangeable so in the shape your habit is kind of shape of a fish just so you can see you know it's more of a contour thing to show you an example of shape we have this piece I did","28":"that shape the next one is color colors be straightforward it deals more with the huge year and colors really easy to pick and Corel Painter you have your key ring here and pick any Hugh you want you can fine-tune the color however you want we're going to do more with the color right now rather than value so color","5":"people who are going to look at so I'm going to show you some different examples of how I use it and just explain what each of these do and how you can use them for your work so we'll start with texture texture is sometimes implied by using different colors and different values like I did hear I'm implying kind of ammo will texture and even though it doesn't really physically have a texture cuz","23":"the next to look at is shape and then I can before she kind of is similar to form it works with form but it's slightly different shape deals more way I like 2D and form is more 3D so shape is kind of the Contour and then if you were to fill it in and make it look three-dimensional than that would be for so they are kind of","27":"and whole thing kind of has a texture to it that","41":"lighter and darker value it's the balance the ratio of this dark to light and everything in the middle of that creates contrast you have to have this contrast enough for things to good especially if you're doing realistic artwork so you should practice doing monochromatic or black and white paintings to get better at this really helps you get good at shading cuz you're not thinking about color and he was so much","15":"did in 2012 and we have the spherical shape here now if I didn't pay attention to my form and imply that form by shading it properly using value and color in next year this would look like a flat disk it wouldn't look like a round sphere so I had to imply that form when I was driving it and then goes with the body down"}
