heel behind the right one","33":"interesting of inversion e-version bring all sorts of interesting and wonderful things in the foot we want to make sure that we're really focused on acts of activating the leg from the core and having that much slow","32":"float the leg up good we also want to pay tension here to what kind of activity is going on in the foot in the ankle typically will see all sorts of interesting patterns of inversion e-version bring","16":"their without soap around the knee so make sure that when you're setting this up that you put the knee strap on 1st and support that","11":"Yellow Springs song from the vertical bar we set this up already for Christus","21":"underneath the part of the waste we also want to make sure that the shoulder girdle is open she is

knee and lower extremity rehabilitation","25":"leg even though her left leg is moving does a lot of work I'm here through the right leg and through the pelvis in order to maintain that stability that she's maintaining of the right leg typically what you might see is instead of the it's like coming up the right like we'll come down so Chris is just going to show you what typically happens with most of us so instead of keeping Sevilla the right leg and then being able to access","10":"knee and lower extremity rehabilitation using the Trap table today and as you can see we already have a long

through the left you'll see a little bit of both so one nice way to think about","29":"ear the life-like the right light can also be a little bit externally rotated just to match that and then from here she's going to float that like up to meet the other so here were accessing a little more external rotation we're also getting a sense of imbalances potentially in the a doctor see so making sure that we're looking at external","34":"acts activating the leg from the core and having that much slow down rather than having the control of the movement and lower the leg down bring the leg back to Center as you can see that is quite a challenging exercise very important for balancing the hip the knees and lower extremity and making sure that our patients are songs from the hip rather than just looking at the structure that's being damaged perhaps the knee","35":"rather than looking at the structure that's being damaged perhaps the knee thank you very much and thank you for watching","19":"neutral in terms of that frontal plane so we want to make sure","17":"you put the knee strap on 1st and support that by suspending it from the spring and and the ankle goes on next so

have","14":"red or a Blue Spring at the other end we also have already free sets if you will with the knee strap and the ankle strap and what we're going to be doing here as we're going to suspend her right leg she can start to work her left leg into a deduction so first of all we're going to hook up the knee strap and this is something to be really cheerful with when you're working with patients who have","31":"see if she bring that left heel behind the right one which is a really really big challenge and then bring the legs forward if you were Christmas and now she's going to take that lower leg into a little bit of flexion and internal rotation and then this is going to pull a little more of the medial quadriceps as you exhale so she can medially rotate that upper leg as well and then float the lower leg up good we also want to pay","27":"through the left see a little bit of both so one nice way to think about this is if we can connect the left zip to the right sit bone so that the activation is starting in the pelvic floor and the deeper core muscles and then creating that nice vacation into the rest of the left leg beautiful so now we're going to go into a little bit of a variation going to bring that looks like back into extension and she's going to external ear the life-like the right","36":"thank you for","15":"cheerful when you're working with patients who have

less balanced so keeping that left leg for now it's going to give her a little bit more stability as we go into her setup we want to make show that at the waist between ribs and collar she's in a neutral position so typically what happens is our patients and students will go into more of a collapse sideband position which is clearly not a neutral position in terms of that frontal plane"}
