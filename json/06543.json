flying around the UK single-handed in the light at Croft c y means Tennessee that is not the message something about any of these people said the film will attempt sister kind of light show from the inside out what it's like to have synesthesia test I did this painting","35":"the color it is is positive it been in a screenshot in the in the top left-hand corner is kind of like Michael Jackson steps I cool them in my head kind of","17":"but can be altered which is kind of really fast","49":"to go for six months and I'm going to come back and show you the instead of saying actually I can

left your basket phone cuz and yeah this is Justice till the end of the film it's meant to be that the film is kind of stretched his innocence reacts saying it's meant to be roughly and somebody was Tennessee's again interesting and they said if they going to show up so there's too much music that will count that seems to be quiet, saying not one thing","13":"sound like a good thing and it's an amazing thing to have any kind of synesthesia so don't feel bad my husband that he said everybody has kind of days the week can I install sweetheart","30":"as I listen to the sound so I played them like a selection of the best day ever they sound kind of funny used in the soundtrack","47":"The film Stop the film yeah","32":"it was that way while I was tricky trying to do this working collaboratively am I kind of did it first with the digital still love each reaction send it to the city this try and they said no eventually had to say so I could do the moving image like an anime 6 animation is 24 friends that I can be really don't want to have to end","50":"my cunning plan about how you can white people into an image and how you can invite people into a filming and collaborate together on it to animation kind of extensive changes or subvert the documentary in some way so that's my that's my current thing","40":"that was very to put forward and other things which is really hard I have synesthesia very often it's not entirely clear card which should I senses are intermingled a couple of times I had experiences when I was interviewing people and they would say well this is Emma's pants Cara so she was trying to explain the sound to me and what it looks like and she couldn't do it in the end she went to the kitchen she came back I thought you meant the color but she meant to text you so another time I was interviewing","7":"please can you go to space to show you and I'm just going to flip through them and talk about them if you have any questions you want to ask it's absolutely fine tune trucks that go ahead yeah it","9":"say what yeah","43":"they told him it's all mixed up together I never said when I play the soundtrack when it had the would have the voice is it says they when I said went back into the case the sound so to doubt his the soundtrack in the voices in graphemes kind of made an entrance so this is Tessa's. only way to put around colors and I said","34":"so this is a that Emma made of part of the soundtrack that she's had it kind of changed it I don't know if people with synesthesia you know kind of appreciate it but if you had like a sound individually it has a different looks when it's a sound conjunction with all the sounds they change each other the same way that like Alexa might be a collar but then when it's in the world it's so it might change this the color it is is positive it","38":"they supposed to take care clinic mountain top of the green Okay so some of the images were some of the reactions really straightforward and they were really easy to stimulates the film Tessa painting the sound of police siren which of the you either you'd recognize him","36":"steps I them in my head kind of like a close as it was a piano note kind of change that's how she's so that's moving and then you cut the head off in the","48":"yeah doing this project was really interesting I'm really love can I buy some of the people I really enjoy to the bringing people into the film and allowing the Ulta the inside of the film I think I make an amazing documentaries that kind of black specialized images of an old thing to do anyway I know but more than that I think what animation can do an adult comentary since it's the kind of invite people into the frame and not just say I can't go I'm going to video you then I'm going to go away for six months and I'm going to come back and show you the instead of saying","12":"Harris and one of the people that we worked with on this was her visualization of her week so if you have college days the week that's kind of it's the most common form of synesthesia but I don't want to say, cuz that makes it sound like it's a good thing and it's an amazing thing to have any kind of synesthesia so","16":"test and what are since that's right what you think what color do you think the days of the week are all the letters of the alphabet or whatever through drawers and then put it away in a drawing a few months time can correlation that they might be safe for chicks and similarity between them but it feels like the car will be something but","21":"literally got to make you some of her cello notes and they just old Scott's was horrible she's she's an animal rights activists shellfish we should start on the 1st trying to be","10":"say what yeah so I was really interested

stained","6":"please can you go to space to show you","24":"since she's very easily kind of trying to explain but she also has a metallic and husband is easy as hell of it required a messy look she's a writer","28":"notes about this and she use the metallic paint trying to transfer this into moving image into something digital computer with a graphics tablet but despite that I did have to kind of like go outside of my comfort zone and start scanning and glitter and playing with tin foil and things in order just kind of trying to convey what it was that that they say","23":"trying to nice you know this is Tessa she's a stained glass window artist another incredible she was and she character she was wonderful to work with because they think I've been doing since she's very easily kind of trying to explain","27":"I did this painting which is when she made it was wet and it was really important to have the wetness of It kind of had a big impact on how it looks so I have to go to make notes about this and she use the metallic paint","41":"she meant to you so another time I was interviewing Tessa and she was high silvery sounds to me she couldn't do it","15":"remember the weekend it's really I think this is kind of interesting that shows has Tennessee's can have a very good memory of of weather and spend some time yeah no it was one of the kind of light defining factors as soon as these is it it's always the same it's always the same for everybody but for that one person that will always be the same if you want to do a kind of totally unscientific test and what are your since that's right what you think what"}
