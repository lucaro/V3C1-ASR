thing and it will always let you down and you'll always have this moment of Shane though always have this thing that you're going back to back to your trying to to overcome that trying to pack it away but you're still having these manifestations of it and Jesus says the simple thing is you've got to let me at it you got to open up I got to be courageous and say I need to let God in so this is how I want this","16":"on the that moments that question is a pertinent question what am I going to do in light of my past in the context of my future what is it that I'm going to do now these are the questions that you're asked it's what I want to do is I want to get into this and it help us to understand this progress of of what our life looks like and how is it that we can begin to operate in a way that text the context of our past and allows that not to be something that dramatically screws up our future you see here's the thing went when","62":"she says that she can see that you're a prophet and what did she do next our ancestors worship on this mountain but you juice claim that the place that we must worship is Jerusalem all the sudden she makes us about a where do I worship issue and Jesus says this woman believe me a time is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem the wrong question here you Samaritans worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews yet a time is coming and has come now","21":"a a Jewish man and in Jews and Samaritans are two different people groups and the area of Samaria was smack-dab in the middle of this Jewish territory and so Jewish people had to go through Samaria or around Samaria to get to the different parts of their state Judea and so in this they had these two options one of the options was to go through it this was rarely the thing that people chose because they hated Jews chose because they hated the Samaritan so much typically they went around it but what we see is Jesus goes right through","10":"crucial that you have some set of contacts for that what I want you to do what I want to do is I want you to see the script that you're living your life by you can say is this the script that I want to live the decisions that I'm making is the point that I'm processing life is that ultimately going to get me future that I desire that's my

kind of way of living life can you get out how do you begin to say how do I live for my future what does this look like and so let's get into this what I'm going to do is give you a little context and then we're going to Dive Right In historians I'm going to read the first four chapters and help us understand what is going on it says this now Jesus learned of the Pharisees it heard that he was gaining and","51":"that's your issue and here's the reality Jesus Jesus knows something about this he know the truth is to heal shame you must reveal shame to heal shame you must reveal shame you cannot let this manifest itself down deep you can't just kind of packet away those things that happened those issues that might have gone on your life in your past you can't just say that just didn't happen","22":"they around it but what we see is Jesus goes right through the middle of Samaria and not only that is he does this and he's earning by himself and it's in the middle or Not by himself with his with his disciples but here we go Jesus by himself and it's the middle of the day and so we're going to pick up birth seven and get into the story when enters a Samaritan woman it says this what is Samaritan woman came to draw water Jesus said to her will you give me a drink you see his disciples a gun into town to buy food first nine the Samaritan woman the","6":"constantly making

as you're making decisions","24":"who would have been a of that culture what we begin to see here is something it is kind of messed up something that's very unusual something that makes no logical since you see first of all what we see is this woman is getting water in and it is well that is out from the town to see all the towns in that time and place when they were to create a town the central feature had to be the availability of water and so they were I had a place for her to get water that was closer to the middle of town because that was what town was built around availability of water and so what will you begin to see here's one odd thing one usual thing one","73":"replace those lies of Shame with allies of the truth of who Jesus is it affects everything T I want you to dress differently because of the Gospel you didn't date differently because of the Gospel I want you to choose a different career path because of the job that the gospel I want you to choose a major because of the Gospel I want you to cheat to change the way you have a marriage because of the Gospel I want you to change the way you spend money because of the Gospel not just because of what the

needs to be redeemed to speak truth what needs to be a spoken truth over in your life so that you may not continue to live in these lies that are rooted in your life but ultimately you would be into walk-in Freedom Jesus says the woman pinpointed the the the root of the issue and I am the only thing that will free you in my view of your life from living out this time","92":"are they that today

people in moment just to just have courage just to be able to say I know it sucks and I know it's hard to go back into experience that again but I'm Thai tired of living like I've been living I'm tired of living in shame so I pray that you would just help us to have a beautiful picture of Hugh Lord I pray that you would help us","53":"Jesus is after the route you see Shane didn't just happen those action didn't just happen they have the root and something there is so in your life that is manifested itself because of shame because of some inadequacy because of things that we all have in our life but let me tell you can go after that over and over figure out how you eliminate that but you will never eliminate that until you go down to the route until you deal and reveal what it is

to it and when she gets there when she interacts with someone what she says is I'm not worthy really to talk to you all this leads us to an idea if she doesn't feel like she is accepted by the culture that she is in and what it looks like is that she even has some bizarre bar Gators that she's manifesting and we can push this back but I think that we do some of the same things in fact in our lives and we begin to think through what this looks like oftentimes there's these behaviors there's these things that happened","5":"what I want to let the secret is that the Bible is incredibly relevant that the Bible has something to say about your life that whatever it is that you're going through whatever it is that you are walking through in your life the Bible has something to say about that and
