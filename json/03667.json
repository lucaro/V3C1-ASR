so","130":"basically just had to line those up we we got the projector in place and made some measurements I had to like kind of go back and forth in in building the physical structure and also

takes in the Kinect to the adreno so it knows the position of the sliders are so it has a script that that part of this out the power of the audio signal a few hundred times a second and it sends that
