{"2":"excited to introduce you to our project gave me this face as a Mother's Day gift custom 3D printed sculpture","11":"that whenever you see the faces it's really beautiful but then as I start to turn around the base I realized there's something more going on here amazing going on here I can see faces in the vase and that does anyone faces I see my children's faces and I see my face and Nick's Phase 2","9":"that","10":"that whenever you see the faces it's really","19":"design review the mobile app where users can upload photos and sea base design your time but what I'm really excited about is to have the chance to experiment with new designs that are still in my SketchBook thanks for supporting clause it's all falls in auxvasse","17":"Emilie Parker's I'm really excited they want their own vase with their own life on spices on it so we started thinking but why not Nick is already written the school program that takes Pro my photos into 3D models as fast as in taking those three","3":"printed sculpture","13":"and I see face and Nick's Phase 2 how did you do that? You see as an architect in computational designer nerd I like to think in terms of systems running and design you one base and then having to think of another next year I set up to solve the Mother's Day conundrum once and for all","14":"once and for","12":"and I see face and Nick's Phase 2","18":"3D models as fast as in taking those three models and getting them 3D printed is expensive so for the kickstarter campaign do is raise enough money to buy her own 3D printer and once with the printer would you know cops are actually pretty low so what's for dinner smiley face and I'll have the opportunity pushes project Ford to new places maybe a new kind of design website review the mobile app where users can upload photos and sea base"}
