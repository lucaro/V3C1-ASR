was something that I've done since I was 15 I started riding mountain bikes and racing mountain bikes back then it got to a point where I was going to turn 18 and I was starting to get into snowboarding and it was either going to try to be a pro or try to be a professional cyclist and you know that the path of professional snake cycling is a lot more training and","14":"well you know I obviously I have my own View and opinion on on why but it wasn't that I wanted to quit snowboarding at the time I wanted to continue on and I had kind of the what I called a three-year kiss of death contract which is where you have a three-year contract near the end of your career which is nice except that when the contract is up usually you don't get reassigned","31":"Well Roots culture connect again you know kind of came from something on Facebook where initially and I was on Facebook and I was just kind of like disappointed in the X Games big air and and the triple cork look for signs which wasn't a triple cork and so I kind of just like you know I copied and pasted the thing up on my Facebook and was like this is this is bullshit and not calling tour Stein bullshit by any means it was because to me you're not being a","33":"so you called me and we started talking about things and we form this idea that there was a need for an online snowboard magazine there really isn't he there's lots of them but you know we think like most other people that we have a special formula that will bring to it that'll be a bit different so yeah so we're getting ready to launch this on the 15th of April ideally and it's just it's more in-depth really we're not trying to do bang or snowboard at its","18":"following trend as far as tricks were going you know can I just get to a point where are you just going to top out and you're like you know you don't have the desire to go to the next level but that's where they you know the new kids come and they're already looking at this level on so they just step it up but oh yeah I didn't I didn't really want to stop snowboarding as a pro","52":"somehow I I keep it all straight and I haven't like falling asleep behind the wheel yet so word is bond is","26":"well you know like that like a lot of things lately it kind of grew organically from I just had to go pro and was out now filming Freeride biking and then start taking it out snowboarding and was posting Clips to my Facebook and someone said and I hate maybe you should have a reality TV show no one's really doing that and I thought well yeah I wouldn't really require require much more from me I was already doing as far as I was already filming stuff anyway so so","35":"or snowboard at its and everything that's already being done we're trying to just put a different spin on it","17":"months got the summer and I'll let you know I would have liked to continue to be a pro and I would have done it for a lot less money than I was making at the time but I was definitely and I was still into snowboarding but I lost the desire for progressing really in that you freestyle round like I still love to do it and had tricks I wanted to get things like that but I

it along the way to the Ali G show out and then no bouncing bouncing working and family and some fun and then also staying up super late at night how to edit episodes and and I do emails for both work side work and","32":"tour Stein by any means it was because to me you're not being a snowboarder in the ex Pro snowboarder I mean obviously he knew what he did and didn't do and it was more of just how the whole event came off and how you know it BK Mexican history and stuff so I put this up on my Facebook and a friend of mine from from back in the old Colorado days reached out to me and my friend Brandon Roby and he said hey we should start a business and I had no idea what he was thinking I said just so you called me and we started talking about things and we form","50":"yeah but you know how it is when you're working on your own projects it's like none of it really feels like and the job I do for my real-life job is a wrap so I wrap bicycle components and and frame other accessories during the summer and during the winter I do helmets and goggles from Giro so I love that as well you know I love the bikes my work is fun my new projects are fun obviously and I love my wife and kids","40":"a in malicious way but more in just a real way so we we we I want to be true to snowboarding in real that's kind of just one of our goals and not you know not pushing a ride or

Nicholas Greenblatt Out of Philly he runs a firm called 215 which is a branding and marketing firm and he also puts out a magazine a small free magazine called living proof and so he will be guiding

do bang or snowboard at its and everything that's","3":"but we brought you and yours","38":"well you know we want to be","36":"trying just put a different spin on it","48":"emails both work side work

instead of just being on the all the time","12":"that I for the pro snowboarder actually","16":"and they sponsoring me you know head to toe and I really only had two binding sponsor and goggles sponsored be on that so when I didn't have my major board company supporting me then it you know it was going to be impossible to make ends meet and do the travel thing and I you know I looked around for a while but never really found anyone to disappoint me you know I love and I look for probably about 6 months got the summer and I'll let you know I","21":"the path professional snake cycling is a lot more training and demented and so I just opted to go with the snowboard route which I'd say was definitely the better route of course at that time cycling was still pretty big and might have been able to make","10":"might have been the last year that I for the pro snowboarder actually","19":"a pro yeah well the","51":"new projects are fun obviously and I love my wife and kids so that's fun and

whatever you get to not rock. better luck next time","23":"anyway I a long time off of that and then it was me surgery that brought me back to cycling azraq and I got back into racing shortly after and and I just I like the cycle cross cuz it's a mix of Technical and it's very intense and just Racing for me and general satisfies my competitive herbs that that I don't really I don't satisfy and snowboarding like I said I and snowboarding it's for me more subjective and so I'm not looking to one-up the next guy you know when rotations maybe","27":"far as I was already filming stuff anyway so so I just kind of started doing it and you know for me it's at is a couple different things like it's it's very creative from the editing standpoint and I used to do a lot of DJing so I don't really do much DJing now but they have the mixing of the clips with the music and timing it to the music and all that satisfies that need for me a bit","41":"that we have any advertisers","15":"when the contract is up usually you don't get reassigned so that kind of happened to me you the contract was coming up and I was with ride snowboards and they were sponsoring me you know head to toe"}
