see other tutorials and examples of my work thank you for watching and","2":"hi I'm Edwin buhok","89":"image brighter because of the greenery added to the","11":"is too much just because of the amount of movement that's in the shot and how much is changing where this clip is ready color color corrected most of the white balance is good and the contrast is very Dynamic we have a dynamic range from 0 to 100 throughout the entire clip basically so we're going to jump into the secondaries","39":"to sand a renewable this so we can see in those Corners that we really I just sit up here and here we can see the difference I'm going to bring down the softness and this is kind of when you're I just kind of use your eye to figure out what looks best they will not I'm liking that so now let's look at what happens when we wake","46":"this is alright so now we're going to go into the next clip","85":"see we take that off at the overall image got","25":"here in the that there's a warmer tone in there so now if we watch the clip","55":"now graded I can definitely see a","42":"then this is enabled","29":"yeah so that's looking pretty good so now that we've did the overall image we are going to go into this and really isolate some certain areas like I said be this has a lot of movement and we can't do too much been getting or too much been getting typically I wouldn't been","58":"can definitely see a complete change in the image this is a much Greener tone very very white balance if we add this","66":"just kind of just a little bit that a light so I'm going to go make 1/3 secondary here and Ativan yet on her","59":"tone very white balance if we add this warm too it completely changes the mood now you can see her her emotions you can feel that she's a little reminiscing a little happier is warm tone to it so tweaker skin tone a little bit so now the next thing I would do","8":"the first thing that I would do is look at the clip from beginning it and like I said this has a lot a lot a lot of movement the beginning of this clip looks very different from the","74":"created ungraded and created","95":"so the next thing that we're going to do is again we're going to isolate some certain areas out I have I have messed up with my room so right now I am in room 3 I forgot to go to the secondary the first secondary here so now my third cycle Mary is my overall image","57":"I can definitely see a complete change in the image","20":"so now we can see the difference 2 we see up here in the grass and the mud that we can really see that difference plus the person that I would do and we're going to look back at the beginning with clip and look at the end that's pretty good so on top of that I'm going to go into the highlights and this is what I we","90":"brighter because of the greenery added to the Shadows","111":"heavy so we are going to go into the vignette here and going to parameters and we're going to increase the size of this vignette so we can see more of his face and there we go and now if I T click that been yet you","14":"E5 a really heavily created image but on the first image on a Spur secondary sorry I usually is the first secondary as the overall image so if I want to do a complete grade to the entire image check the saturation or the contrast of the entire image this is where I would do it so the first","31":"secondary now so we moved from this first secondary which is our overall image 2 hours second secondary and I'm going to snow have been yet so when I click that vignette button right here you can see that it pops up a circle here we can go we can change the shape to a square if we wanted we can make a user shape but I took we like to use circles each of this is kind of a personal preference here","78":"then ends in a static shot here on a little kid so when I think of flashbacks I think of a possibly a sepia tone or warmer tone I know many flashlights really different and you want to create a look for your film for the flashback scene that will fit in the overall film but also split it apart from the present time and the flashback time","112":"there we go and now if I T click that been yet you can see that that vignette is a little lighter","70":"softness and we're going to adjust her contrast in her face alone so we're going to increase the gain stretch that out and then we're going to bring down the Mesolithic compensate increasing up and then increase the gamut tiny bit now let's see what we do with that secondary so now you see her face is popping better","106":"the film to the scene","33":"it is wider almost almost like a square or rectangle was still rounded edges and then I'll change the angle so I'm going to actually type in and I'm going to make this 35 we're going to guess here so that's a little bit too much so I'm going to go to 25 about where I want I'm trying to get this angle we're here and vignette besides up","18":"cold or tone so we're going to be on the Shadows to the blue area so I'm going to exaggerate this for a second and we can see the entire image can you see a lot of these darker areas are really affected and we see on the histogram that the blues have gone up and typically I mean see that this could be like a Hollywood Blockbuster type of look but that's not we're going for this is a very independent","52":"real quick and now graded","121":"colors secondaries room and the color affects room","69":"Angela tried on her face there increase that softness and we're going to adjust her","114":"and then we have a gamete II gamla channel that is used here in the street this is affecting just the overall damn of the image and then we look at the blur and like I said we can decrease the blower a little bit and then look at this game on this is adding a greenish","109":"secondary is it prominent","96":"third cycle Mary is my overall image now I'm grading so as you can see it gets kind of confusing after a while so you really have to be on top what rooms are using or just remember that your third room is your overall look so let's go II room and we're going to add a we're going to add a vignette and the way that we're going to do this","26":"tone in there so now if we watch the clip yeah and that that's more cinematic feel it gives and tells the story","35":"going a harsh change I'll show you here instead of going from a change of 0 where it goes directly from white to black now if we increase the softness that is making it nice nice gradient going from white to black and we're going to increase this year I want to go back to this fall color","83":"you can see if we take that off at the","17":"there so I look at my clip see if there's anything different and histogram of the vector scope there's nothing that different so I'm pretty satisfied with the saturation there no I know that this clip is very somber like I said so typically in a somber feel would be a blue or tone a cold or tone so we're going to be on the Shadows to the blue","64":"white this was area so I can bring that down alive looking pretty good so let's see what we just did we","65":"looking good so let's see what we just did we just brought down that side of the that looks a lot more natural so have a look at our image pretty good and the last thing that I made you would be I would highlight her face a little bit more just kind of just a little bit that a light","49":"can bring this down 2.95 it's just a very subtle desaturation but I feel like that looks a little better so now we're going to go into the color again we're going to add a warmer ambertone here in the shadows alright I add a little warmer Town into the skin tone into her skin tone so again I'm a kind of","44":"him I'm so I'm pretty satisfied with this shot I really like this color grade so let's look at the the color grade graded and ungraded so here is degraded I'm sorry well it's like a degraded image so we're going to disable the gray sheer that is option G so we can","84":"you can see if we take that off at the overall","4":"check it out so here we are an apple colors secondaries room into the timeline three different clips that have different movement or different feel different cinematic feels from the same film that I just shot in January so we're going to look at these clips the first of which is","37":"to the outside so the white part is represented in what's the inside and the black part is representative what's on the outside I","110":"so are we going to do we're going to tweak with the settings in this because the vignette is a little much in the blur is very heavy so we are going to go into the vignette","45":"gray that is option G so we can option G I'm sorry Control G Control G as you can see on this image up here that we've changed a lot to it this is ungraded and this is","13":"here so have 8 secondary that we can do I have never gone up to 8 the maximum that I've really gone up to Wood E5 on a really heavily created image","86":"that off at the overall image got","67":"to go 1/3 secondary here and Ativan yet on her face organized Justice size I'm going to angle","99":"we're to throw on a preset that comes with Apple color it's called the defocus vignette warm and the best way to learn this room is just through practice so I'm going to double click this to set this so as you can see if we do what we just did there up here","93":"if year","117":"around edges on a yeah if we could leave this grade here we can see that that was strictly working on the vignettes what time do that","94":"if year","105":"like to the to the film to the scene","30":"much been getting typically I wouldn't been yet if this is a static shock like this I would highlight his area and bring him bring the surrounding area down so that he is a little bit better and she's the sole subject of the image but because there's so much Movement we can't isolate just that one area so I'm going to go to my second secondary now so we moved from this first secondary","115":"this is a greenish orange tone to it and then increase in the gamma so this Alpha blend is a way for these parts of the tree the blur the vignette the gamma to link and to only affect what is in this vignette so does Boron the game that we did and the scam it to is only affected in the dark areas","47":"so now we're going to go into the next clip here so this clip like I said of the sea attic shot of a woman picking up a toy phone so she's reminiscing about the past and her sons childhood here so this is kind of a happier moment a warm moment and if you saw the rest of the film I created the basement","54":"and now graded I can definitely see","32":"I took like to use circles each of this is kind of a personal preference here so what I like to do it is with images that move a lot is just kind of giving overall been yet not an oval vignette that you typically see I like increase the size of this and then increase aspect where it is wider almost almost like a","50":"the skin tone into her skin tone so again I'm a kind of eyeball list on what I feel looks right I'm going to go around there and then we're going to bracket this a tiny bit with the blue so that the whites in here on the telephone are so that we know that white white is","77":"so now we're going to move into the last clip here and this last kiss this is a dream sequence of flashback sequence that goes back to a childhood flashback so are we looking this image is going to slide Dolly and then ends in a static shot here on a little kid","40":"I'm liking that so now let's look at what happens when we wake up but take away those yellow lines if you click this button right here and I will take away those yellow line so we can actually see the image so remember we have did these side area the top left in the bottom right so we're giving up there's no difference at is a big difference in","80":"that green tone it was as some sort of eerie feeling to it I'm a lot horror films use the color green it's kind of sickly so this flashback was an argument happening with his parents so we're going to have a little green in that and then in his skin tone we're going to warm up his skin to tiny bit and I were going to","101":"if we do what we just did there up here I'm","82":"you can see if we take that off","91":"because of the greenery added to the Shadows so let's decrease the master lift here in this overall image and now we're a lot more dynamically contrast if year","7":"so let's go to the first clip we have on the timeline and we're going to start jumping into the color grading and making it look cinematic the first thing that I would do is look at the clip from beginning it and","9":"the beginning of this clip looks very different from the end over here we have an over-the-shoulder shot at the end he's really","43":"extremely subtle but you can tell the difference and it definitely enhances the Moon and the Sun sorry because it isolates him I'm so I'm pretty satisfied with this","60":"so now the next thing I would do is I see that this left side was kind of improperly Lititz a lot bro on this side than it is on the right side you can see this on the preview monitor up here so we're going to fix that and how we're going to do that is with a yet like in the first clip that we color graded be that many at the kind of decrease the amount of","34":"we're and vignette besides up here so I'm going to increase the size again not looking better and now I'm going to increase the softness so you see what I see Christmas office is kind of like Feathering Photoshop when I increase that's office instead of going a harsh change I'll show you here","75":"ungraded and created so you can see it as a lot more warrants in this image but so is it a slight Korean on to it and the green towel and I used in a lot of the secretive areas or where in the story the violin I'm kind of was found and so that green tone was seen throughout the film","104":"preview you can see that were adding a lot of what's the weather they've been yet and it's giving the stream like filled to the to the film to the","87":"that off at the overall image got brighter because of the","103":"that up here in the preview monitor you can see that were adding a","3":"hi I'm Edwin buhok Productions has its own distinct love because of the film stock that they use all the color grading that they used in today's sartorial I'll be going with the color secondary and grades room new techniques that'll make your phone look more cinematic let's check it out so here we are an apple","61":"that many at the of decrease the amount of light in the edges top and bottom right edges so in this image we're going to vignette solely this left side trying to create that been yet again increase the size rate increase the softness I'm going to increase this aspect I'm going to go up this way now we're going to","79":"the present time and the flashback time so what we did was we gave it a warmer sepia tone and so what we're going to do is we're going to start with the Shadows again on the color wheel and bring that into a greenish area and I chose that because again that green tone it was as some sort of eerie feeling","38":"the black part is representative what's on the outside I want to do I'm just going to give it a small thing yet so I'm going to bring down the lift on the edges I'm going to bring down the cane on the edges you can see on the hill I'm over here that's going down and then I got to take to decrease the camera a tiny bit and maybe we'll make the size of this little bit smaller so we're going to see what the unable to sand a renewable this so we can see","118":"that strictly working on the vignettes what time do that","71":"so now you see her face is popping better the contrast in her face is looking a lot better and now I think that's a pretty good grade image let's see what this looks like ungraded","120":"so that is the Apple colors secondaries room and the color affects","36":"year I want to go back to this fall color here snout working affect the inside and outside so there's a control up here on inside and outside so are we going to do is going to the outside so the white","48":"you saw the rest of the film I created the basement footage I gave it all a certain look I gave it a little greenish tint to it but a warmer feel as well so we're going to do that here so again I'm going to go to the first secondary room here cuz that's always My overall look and I'm going to run out of saturation a little bit I can bring this down 2.95 it's just a very subtle","113":"that vignette is a little lighter and you can also bypass the vignette so that you can see what you're actually working with and","76":"green tone was throughout the film so now we're going to move into the","12":"going to jump into the secondaries canaries room like I went over in my overview of color is very similar to the primary and so the first thing that I'm going to do is where can I use this first secondary right here so we have 8 secondary that we can do I have never gone","100":"if we do what we just did there up here","81":"up his skin to tiny bit and I were going to even this all out in the highlights little bit blue you can see if we","98":"is a very complextro I have not messed with this completely but they have a lot of presets here and then a lot of effects left tab over here and this is very complex and give a lot of things with this room alone so we're going to throw on a preset that comes with Apple color","122":"secondaries room and the color affects room and like you saw we can do a lot with ice Linux areas of the shot like we did in the second clip with her face or affect the overall image there's there's a lot more that we can do with all this but here the basics of the secondaries in the color affects room I hope you enjoy this tutorial I'm a true 4 wheel Hop Production","16":"that this Anna supposed to be in so I know that this is a very depressing scene and as I can see from the Shahi ends up in a vert isolated shy he's really small on the screen so I'm going to bring down the saturation and in and around there .86 I'm generally I probably go around there so I look at my clip see if","62":"this now we're going to increase the angle and see estimate where we want to go so I see it's kind of a slight plant to the upright that's going from bottom left to top right so I'm going to go negative here and negative with safety teen and that's pretty close we're going to bring this over to the side so they were only fighting this","107":"the film to the scene still that green in that what we created in the secondary is it still prominent","21":"I'm going to go into the highlights and this is what I we called bracketing it's only bracket we are going to even this out in the highlights so because we brought the Shadows down into the Blue Area I'm going to even out the highlights and warm it up so our are evenly spread out it within the color so I'm going to move that over there and fight undo that we can see that","10":"different from end over here we have an over-the-shoulder shot at the end he's really small on the screen I'm so it's the amount of color grading that work to do this image is not too much just because of the amount of","102":"we do what we just did there up here I'm sorry if we undo that up here in the preview monitor","19":"of but that's not we're going for this is a very independent film very somber scene so we just want to add the tiny bit of do in the shadows here so I'm going to go around there and this one right here at the HS reset this kid will reset to back to normal this is kind of like an undue so I'm going to undo that and so now we can see the difference 2","51":"so that we know that white white is actually truly White I'm liking that I'm liking that well let's look at that ungraded real quick","22":"so going to move that over there and fight undo that we can see that in the especially in the highlights up here","6":"high an next clip is a static shot of a woman picking up a toy telephone and then the last shot is a dream flashback sequence of a little kid that is listening to a conversation of his parents fighting so let's go to

beginning and to the end now that looks like it's a flashback scene so that is the Apple colors secondaries room","53":"and now graded I can","116":"did and the it to is only affected in the dark areas of the VIN so as you can see if we take away this grade look around these edges on a yeah if we could leave this grade here","72":"let's see this looks like ungraded and created","28":"feel it gives and tells the story through the color and that's what this program is designed to do tell a story with the color it I'm in the Midtown is we've just kind of just for his skin town which looks pretty good maybe we'll cool that down a tiny bit give it even more of a depressing look to it yeah so that's looking pretty good","123":"I hope enjoy this tutorial I'm a true 4 wheel Hop Production and go to my website","5":"so we're going to look at these clips the first of which is a jib crane shot that ends up pretty high up an next clip is a static","23":"that in the especially in the highlights up here in the sky","63":"bring this over to the side so they were only fighting this side over here so we're going to call the inside this time not the outside because the inside of the vignette is right here so we're going to bring that over here said that I'm going to bring down that Master game like we did before because I know this is white this was white area so I can bring that down","27":"feel it gives and tells the story through the","56":"now I can definitely see a complete change","97":"to add a vignette and the way that we're going to do this is actually not in the

difference in the shot we can't really tell because we've had such a soft been yet on it so let's let's see the difference this is unable and then this is enabled","15":"is where I would do it so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm bring down the saturation some of the scroll this down here on the saturation just because I would have previously talked to the director the Director of Photography and kind of got a feel for what part of the story this is or the type of mood that this Anna supposed to be in so I know"}
