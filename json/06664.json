word brother she actually does have a brother it's not a fake brother bit but he wasn't there obviously it to answer the thing is I know that she's not going to wear what she wanted to what you want to see her brother's not what she would want to wear to get engaged in right and so so I take her to this place and they do a makeover and they sent her to the dressing room this dressing room Guinness as a note in that behind that note is for the dress and so she gets in there and she is able to get to it to","21":"clear snarky that he must go to Jerusalem right to go to Jerusalem he did that to suffer many things he did that under the hands of the elders check priest check and teachers of the law and he must be will check and on the third day be raised to life it's almost as if they have just quoted what Jesus quoted and told them we're from her back and Matthew 16 is unpacked this thing and somehow in light of all of this this idea this conspiracy has not been grounded in their hearts that they can aren't there somehow they didn't","10":"and this is kind of a once-a-year kind of thing for you but I promise you there is something more to do that we're going to get into did the story about Jesus as told by this guy named Luke he writes this gospel which means the good news in this good news is Jesus in a part of that he's telling about this interaction between Jesus and these two dudes that are trying to figure out this event that we will call Easter from here on out but they're trying to figure this thing out and figure out is there a connection is there conspiracy or is just this just a thing and Jesus interact with him so we're going to look at Luke 24 verse 13","19":"he is lived out and and kind of how people have responded is kind of amazing thing and what

how slow to believe all the prophets have spoken did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter into the store and I can hold on Stranger you were the one who asked what things we told and all the","51":"mower there's something that interacted with their hearts and they began to say oh my goodness if this is true this has something to do with my life and it's the same thing that you have to come into and to contact is this the same thing that will come to face to face with your life when the conspiracy gets personal didn't our heart burn within us when conspiracies get personal and it changes everything and one of the things that when we begin to think about conspiracies what I think about is it was people are involved in conspiracies oftentimes","22":"in their that they can aren't there somehow they didn't get it somehow all that what has happened in this connection to something more to something greater all the events are still kind of disc acted in this and here's what Jesus does in verse 27 it says this end beginning with Moses and all of the prophets he explains to what was said in the scriptures concerning himself some Jesus begins to say hold on let me connect all of the let letting me share with you","6":"ideologies basically what happens is there's these events and these events maybe are compelling on their own make maybe there is significant on their own what happens that blows our mind if you've ever had a movie or show that has these moments of being able to put together these conspiracy ideas is what begins to to really make more sense is when we begin to see that these events these people these transactions all this stuff he's location they're not just this thing in themselves but they're connected to something bigger and when we have that moment it in that Stevie Series in that","24":"a little bit like this take a look so what does that do to you how does that hit you where does that last for them as they","73":"road and said do not be

talking about to let me tell you how rude my wife I want to tell you how I I would my girlfriend to become my fiance and later become my wife You See It Started With Me creating this conspiracy Chris it started with me putting all of this I'd rather see I had this plan right I got in the ring and now I needed to figure out how","72":"either it or it's complete rubbish what is it going to be cuz you have a God who is wooing you he was trying to Open the Eyes of your heart for you to see what he is about for you to see the story for this to be something that begins to take hold in your life and he is doing this and this is a story it is a from the very beginning where Jesus interacts with these guys know on the road and said do not be foolish you've got to see this whole thing","28":"where would Slaughter and innocent man it's so what he does is a week before this happens a week before we eat we begin to see Jesus do something that is never happened before Jesus his friend Lazarus he finds out that he's sick but what happens is he waits until Lazarus dies and Lazarus is for Days Inn Raven says that he's stinky and it's obvious that he is dead and then he goes and any cuts to the front of Lazarus is too and and what he does is he overcomes death and he says Lazarus come forth death","5":"submit you that there is a conspiracy that God is woven into the world and

about that right and so but I want you to get this this conspiracy theory that didn't it's here in our midst that we when we begin to unpack it we begin to discover something that's incredibly compelling most conspiracy ideologies basically what happens is there's these","23":"connect of the let letting me share with you the conspiracy what would have been like to hear Jesus begin to take all these random events been that were kind of meaningless myself that if they were to speak seen as random events ultimately allowed this person or a kind of causes person to be discouraged and distraught with a Down cast and he begins to put all of the pieces together imagine what that moment would have been like in fact it might have been just a little bit like this take a look","63":"for the dress and so she gets in there and she is able to get to it to put on the stress she looks pretty she said she feels good inside the neck place that she goes is Ponte Vedra Beach Florida and end

was there parked and in that and I and also not only that is they were","41":"are Jesus contradicts himself for the hypocrisy of the church to be honest none of that really matters to me because if he overcame death I'm with Jesus it doesn't matter really anything else he can say gibberish right but if he has the power over death he's the guy that I want to align my life with because this means everything in fact for these guys who heard this for these guys who listen to this what happens is these guys go these cowardly Guys these people that are saying Jesus we don't want to go where it's dangerous Jesus we don't want to go where there might be something","15":"this is something that the hundreds of thousands of people would have descended upon Jerusalem this wasn't a small event like
