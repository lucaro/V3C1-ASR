{"18":"place heel and line up the achilles with the back Notch of the footplate there's the access point right at that sub Tyler and second toe lines up with the front Notch now carefully cuz","30":"and of course we're looking for any rotation in the stabilization side any lateral shift any hike but just really trying make that happen at joint level now for the next exercise I'm going to have you slide one of the functional foot plates forward in a natural step distance so carefully step off of here and we will bring one foot plate","33":"again we're going to see what happens when she's in a natural step distance Bonnie's to rotational surfaces this left foot still wants to go out into that 30 degrees of external rotation and if we then saw her walk you may see that that side is the one that likes to go into that medial whip it goes into external rotation so just being a to","32":"the plates I will help all that still for you as you step up and any other plate again we're going to see what happens","2":"hello and welcome to our balance","16":"rotates also notice that this is a nice strengthener for that medial Arch it's a nice functional strengthener for that medial Arch opposed to those old tow sconces and tell scrunches cuz you don't want to pattern that constriction of the toes you just want it to be from the actual Arch","11":"now we get to see degrees here there's there's a reading of degrees of extension or rotation 9 degrees of rotation and where I would like Michelle to be is around 5 to 7 degrees of x turn on rotation and see if she can maintain that never going to isolate this movement to below the knee","21":"you can see that on Michelle left foot she is in 30 degrees of external rotation and on that right side she's about at 10 what's considered normal range","39":"foot plates","7":"of the you will get that feedback by tipping out the first seek we're going to","9":"Serena place your foot line up the Achilles the subtalar","25":"what do you feel just trying to maintain that 5 to 7 degrees this is what you will hear most of the time so that's a good way just too cute into inner thigh and to start bringing realizing what she needs to work on that will help you guys your session as to what she needs to work on in the rest of the pilate session so bringing awareness if you are working with a dancer and you want to work on","10":"foot line up the Achilles the subtalar and the second toe now we","26":"bringing awareness if you are working with a dancer and you want to work on internal rotation you'll notice that if you were to tip your weight slightly forward that that plate hits the front of the wood and back","29":"and Alternate sides to get external rotation while stabilizing an external and of course we're looking for any rotation in the","34":"it into external rotation so just being a to stay in this position you're feeling and get her thigh so this helps to point out what she needs to work on in order","35":"to out what she needs to work on in order to bring that external","19":"up with the front Notch now carefully cuz this is a moving surface step up with the other foot going to the footplate obviously you would not do this with someone that has a balance challenge or give them something to stand on or hold onto now the first thing I want do is just stand here and relax letting your body go into its natural position where it likes to go don't try to change anything I would like to see where you just are in","17":"the actual Arch now we're going to move on to the standing work with the functional footplates so I'm going to have Michelle go ahead and come on up to standing and we're going to place your heel","8":"the first seek we're going to show you on the functional footplate is done seated rental line Michelle's foot up there's a back not here that we're going to lie that with the Achilles then the access point of the foot right where the ankle comes down into the foot and in the second toe lines up with this notch Serena place your foot","22":"about at 10 what's considered normal range motion that we want for actual proper gait mechanics isn't anywhere from 5 to 7 degrees of external rotation from the foot so if we can get her back in toward 5 to 7 degrees without working the knee so you don't want to force that if they don't have the internal rotation the hip joint and it ends up twerking the knee then you're going to have","6":"they also slight instability front to back so if you're not at the access point of the foot you will get that feedback by tipping out","24":"your way so I'm just going to bring awareness to where I would like you the try and maintain that and what do you feel just trying to maintain that","4":"hello and welcome to our balance body podcast here at EHS Pilates in San Francisco my name is Nancy Meyers and we have Michelle O'Day helping me out today as my lovely foot model we're going to introduce to you the functional footplates these were invented by Jean-Claude West who is an amazing movement practitioner in Marin and the foot","37":"keep them ahead and really Q into that like internal rotation from the fee and she gets better hip extension thank you for joining us enjoy your functional foot plates","3":"hello and welcome to our balance body","28":"and again the plate will hit the back of the wood so you really have to be balanced on that access point for the rotation to happen now I would like you to keep your left foot straight ahead and then just the right goes into external rotation and back and Alternate sides to get external","5":"and the foot show foot plays are similar to your rotation discs in that they rotate what makes them unique is they also have slight instability front to back","38":"your functional foot plates","20":"go don't to change anything I would like to see where you just are in the foot plates have degrees of extension direct I keep saying such a rotation so you can see that on Michelle left","23":"the hip joint and it ends up twerking the knee then you're going to have to just work your way in so I'm just going to bring awareness","13":"of that first metatarsal even if you have to assist them in doing so cuz we don't want to have ankle go into supination an external","14":"to ankle go into supination an external and internal so here were hopefully mobilizing. head of the tib fib here you can see if there is movement happening or not from that joint level because there should be movement from that joint when the foot is internally and externally rotating","31":"and we will bring one foot plate forward as if she just took a step and carefully come back onto the plates I will help all that","27":"plate the front of the wood and back and again the plate will hit the back of the wood","36":"to bring that external rotation back into a more functional position and now we're taking that into plantar flexion and back down and if she were not controlling this as well as she is you would see this spin out so it gives you a nice tactile cute to keep them straight ahead and really Q into that like","15":"and Ashley intern rotates you'll also notice that this is a nice","12":"going to isolate this movement to below the knee so I don't want her to move the knee and we're going to have you use this rotation without signaling the foot keeping the foot flat on the plate the foot is time to have a tendency to roll out and we want you to keep contact of that first metatarsal even if you have to","1":"hello and welcome to our"}
