{"68":"but over and over it gives us the source that is not of ourselves and that is the it is this secret of Christianity when it comes to relationship that we were able to say you know when we begin to see this absurd stuff in the Bible that we are to forgive one another and end in Jesus says they're asking Jesus how many times should I forgive and he says basically as much as it takes is a 70 * 7 basically he's not saying that that's a number that should be the end of it he saying it is more than you can count it is it is more than you can feel it is","2":"transformative in our lives and I and I hope that you're getting a lot out of this at we were speaking to you in a very relational format in terms of just what has happened internally for us and all these guys who spoken Craig last week I just did a great job in just unpacking what has been transformative in his life and we continue to grow throughout the series and I hope it that the end result is you begin to look to the Bible Anna and are saying this is this is the source of the information that changes my life that that transforms my world and so that's kind of our and go as we do this at tonight what","89":"you reveal where we have failed to live gracefield lives Lord that you would reveal how how we have misunderstood the cross Lord how we have misunderstood what you've done to yes Lord that somehow we have not allow that to sink into our hearts and so we can bend that out into the relationships around this Lord make that crystal clear up rake Holy Spirit tonight you just think those realities think those

a good person so I won't do to you what you did to me and what happens in our hearts is that creates a divide that that that even if it kind of makes her actions different our hearts often Heart Change by the Golden Rule our hearts Harbor beating bitterness I'm doing to treat you the way that I would want to be treated but I'm not going to forget the way that you treated me and so that's where I often see people do on the outside of this relationship and even marriages it","46":"and so no longer do we have to put on the I'm having good relationships but when we begin to live towards the gospel Rule and not the Golden Rule it clarifies for our hearts what we should expect we should be about how we are to live towards other people in his all because we are conduits of Grace we are not manufacturers of Grace the Golden Rule makes you the manufacturer of Grace the gospel rule makes you the conduit of Gracie or the vehicle of Grace and you will run out of Grace if it is supplied by you will have an endless supply if your orientation","85":"this is what helped me to understand how I'm to live towards everyone else I'm not perfect at it I over and over have to remind myself okay Keith stopped at lunch thinking that's a mirror, thinking that's a stone count you need to see all of the people around you through the lens of the cross and when that happens it's true formative in our lives we're going to sing a couple more songs we're going to get into this we're going to","25":"of these because they just don't see it like I see it and so I had to figure out something and I knew that I couldn't continue the same trajectory and that something had change so I begin to get its into scripture and just begin to say what is it that looks like how is it that I begin to understand what it is that kind of connects these relationships and how I can do this in a sustainable way and when I begin to realize is it when I begin to get into scripture begin to open this idea of the rules that we live by","55":"the Lord forgave you I hope you're starting to see some theme here right because this rule is becoming a parent as we walk through scripture we begin to see the source of forgiveness is not because they deserve it the source is because you have been forgiven and so when I have an issue someone in my life and I think why did they deserve to be forgiven because isn't that the biggest issue in our relationships when someone has done something wrong with us the issue is what should I what do they deserve for me just to forgive them they have wronged me they have hurt me they have done","42":"by the moral rule I'm living by this religious Golden Rule see Jesus talked about this but he Isis and said this is the law and the prophets when we see the Bible the law in the proper for it that is not where it ends and so our relationship should not end with the law and the prophets our relationship should not end with the golden rule because functionally is difficult self-reliant have a self reliance in this into live towards relationships with an ongoing sense of Grace","29":"the Bible when I begin to realize is the I was going by the wrong rules and dysfunctional view of Christianity I'm sorry I had to have the spirit of you but my functional view of Christianity was nothing near what the Bible says and so I look this verse and I realize that I've been going about my life all wrong when it comes to relationships and this was the aha moment and this is what I want to share with you because maybe you've had those tension moments in your relationships this changed everything about me fact it changed everything so significantly better preach the","58":"of we don't get known as much see he said forgive as the Lord forgave you soak to be honest you and meet this is not about the way we feel we live towards God in a way that said I'm going to go my own way you should could decide to have this beautiful relationship the ship and I spit on it I said I want to be my own God I'm going to set myself up and charge","66":"true you so when it comes to why shouldn't we submit to someone's Authority why should we be able to Humble ourselves because they deserve it no this is never the answer for us and I would I would I would gladly follow that person if they were worth following no it goes back to this gospel rule Jesus didn't consider equality with God something to be grasped and so he humbled himself volunteer latara Lee how","59":"I'm going set myself up and charge and got to that here's what I'm going to do I'm going to send my son to redeem this relationship that you fractured I'm going to off for forgiveness so when it comes to why we should say an undeserving person should be forgiven because we were a nundes good person

lenses become lenses which with every everything else makes sense it's so huge struggle to forgive if there's a I think in talking to people in in in in in in kind of walking through this one of the things that is the reality is that people don't understand I have been forgiven forgiven but likely if you have forgiveness tissues one of the things that you should explore is if you really sense that you are clean you are completely accepted before got","57":"that moment functionally we aren't living towards Christ functioning the rules that we are living by have more to do The Rock have more to do with I'm going to get back at you because of what you've done with me and so that might be an aggressive way that might be a fight that might be a passive that might be you kind of pulling out of the relationship but it's not pursuing death in that relationship and haven't we done that we get hurt we pull out leave kind of we don't get known as much","20":"so there is tension in my heart that along with that the stresses that went on if beginning to understand how to be a pastor and it and how to carry the weight of people that have burdens and have issues and bring them to their pastor do with him these need these tensions of leaving a staff and an inventory for the first time as a pastor beginning to know how to orient my life towards the leading other guys and then ladies in terms of what they do vocationally all this going back even down to it my marriage and so I found myself in these places of tension I found myself and these places were I was trying to","90":"she

they do not deserve anything but we freely","14":"an want to say so proud of you giving and a hand thank you guys for yeah that confirms that that was the dumbest idea we've ever had and so I'm getting what I want to talk to you guys about what that silly thing hopefully begins to put in her head it's just the idea that when we begin to. in life there are certain things that we have expectations are in fact there are certain rules that we kind of live our life around and so when","31":"that really we by it and we begin to think about what are the rules that dictate the relationships between each other it kind of has three different things one is what I would call the the moral Rule and so the moral rule is this do unto others as they have done unto you it's so it's that thing that's the oldest rule that we have in our as a society that has Humanity goes back as its it to the Hammurabi code where this is an eye for an eye if you throw a rock through my window then I threw a rock through Yours","78":"say you what it is easy for me to have humility among other people I don't have to build myself up and protect my image I can simply live words other people in submission and humility I can bear with another person because I've been born with Jesus walk wrong timing for that for those of you this is not me this might not be that you don't understand what God has done but it's because you have decided not to live what is been lived towards you by Christ","70":"source and will always at some point see there's two reasons why this doesn't work there there's two reasons why the gospel rule is an applied to our life is this that you make truly not under you might not truly understand what God has done to you so whenever talk about this idea that this forgiveness acceptance encouragement serving others all of these submission should be the way that we live towards others if we can't say I I can't do that key that","33":"that's kind of how the world has existed for for many years and what this does though is this creates fractured untrusting societies that basically just in a contract in terms of our friendships in terms of all of our relationships they're only contractual if you do this to me then I will do this back to you and there's no safe spot for us to live but it creates peace and then we begin to get the Old Testament we begin to see this new kind of thing where we get this thing called the Golden Rule and the golden rule is this just kind of this religious format","18":"a kind of process for me it wasn't that long ago in the course of my life is a few years ago and as we begin to launch resonate church as we begin to get into the process of starting this whole thing Emerson relational conflict that I just begin to go through part of this was relational conflict of us starting a church that was kind of different and people from the outside having questions just like any any time something goes outside the box or something is is innovative there's there's some people that say Hey that's not the way that we do it and through that first process this first couple years","52":"no there's a source of this and if you don't know the source it's not going to work for long be completely humble and gentle how are you completely humble and gentle it is because you're living your life worthy of the calling how are you patient now there's some of you here like me who struggle with patience with people and in those moments where do I have to say live my life worthy of the calling that I've received it is not because they deserve to be patient with it is not cuz I should be gentle with him or humble in the scenario","69":"you can count it is it is more than you can feel it is continually over and over and over and over to say this and where do you get the source of that because if you've ever been in a relationship where you always have to say I'm sorry how to say it's okay I forgive you it's okay I forgive you it's okay I forgive you in our hearts sometimes that can get to a place where we are no longer ready forgive if we are living the Golden Rule kind of religion being a source and will always at some point see there's","26":"into begin to open this idea of the rules that we live by and all of us live by these rules all of us lived through these kind of world you rules that really kind of say how that we live around people how how we kind of live our life in in relationship and what I begin to do is have you been to get in the scripture and so I get in the words and try to figure out what these rules how is it that I can live in a way that is kind of long-term not just trying to push bitterness down or push anger down but really and to be free and live towards people in the way that","35":"this really significant this is a completely different change right when it comes to the rules that we live towards each other I was living in a way that you know where is this fair thing and this might still be the case for for many of us I know that that was for me that kind of mentality that I live my life around it's the rule around my house you know you put I'll push you if you have kids you're living by that that I for nyko that's kind of the normal way for us to kind of say this is at least the way of Peace this is why fight for right but then we go to this

repent from from having this view of God that did they kind of is in essence a view of this gospel Ruben its functionality in others we must fall back in love with Jesus so that we might fall back in love with the people around us I believe I believe that you will be an incredible loving person with deep relationships if the","17":"the that we think are fair in the things that other people think are fair often Clash this leads us to some places of continual tanks in our lives what we begin to process this would try to figure out how relationships are supposed to fit together and how long term that I get along with this person or I live in community with that person or in our marriage and our friendships and all these things for me I think one of the things when I and to think through how is Gospel change my lighthouse scripture change my life it's basically a kind of process for me it wasn't that","64":"brothers and that none of you has a sinful unbelieving heart that turns away from the Living God but encourage one another daily as long as it's called today so that none of you may be hardened by sins deceitfulness we've come to share and Christ if indeed we hold our original conviction friendly the very end this is talking about this idea of encouraging so we don't just encourage just to be good people because we are living towards Christ and we should be in in I meant to other people this is the relationship this is the orientation towards other people that we should have us go on to Philippians 2:5 it says this","65":"2:5 it says this in your relationships with one another have the same mindset of Christ Jesus who being in the very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own Vantage rather he made himself Nothing by taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness in your relationships with one another he's giving a now picture this is how Christ live true to you so when it comes to why shouldn't we submit to","49":"it's not allowing me to have the essence and the beauty of relationships that God is intended and over and over as I get older as I begin to see things more clearly it is all about relationships at the end of your life it is about relationship at the beginning of your life is about relationships between those two things no matter what you try to accomplish with you it always goes back to relationships are the most important thing I can tell you is how to live in these relationships so let's listen as as we begin to walk through the Bible and look at this it first starts officiants in Ephesians 4:1 it says this","44":"rule the gospel is do unto others Christ has done unto you so we begin to see it's not the rock it's not the mirror but it is the cross that stands at the center of this and so when we begin to look at this all the it begins to be super transformative in our lives because we are seeing through the lens of the Cross we're seeing through something completely different my orientation towards my relationships are not what you deserve what you've done to me not even what I wish was done unto me my orientation to","84":"incredible loving person

say come up here on the stage was it set up or anything all right this is going to be","37":"we to live each other live towards each other the way that we would want to be treated and that's probably what you heard the golden rule is pretty big with us through our society you've probably heard that thing land some somewhere in your life and it's a good thing but problem is is it for us it's still is something that leads functionally to our self-reliance of being good people and have you ever been in those moments where the Golden Rule just wasn't enough where someone has","45":"I wish was done unto me my orientation to my relationships are now because Jesus has loved me it so we won't be begin to see it's just amazing vertical relationship that is now bent out horizontally and what this does is it gives us a reason to live in relationships that are deeply loving deeply connective and it eliminates a source of anger and bitterness in our lives and so no longer do we have to put on the

that you have submitted for me I don't feel that yeah there's somehow that there is we come this this agenda this economy of earned instead of this economy of Grace and desire for us to be","67":"latara Lee how are we to live in terms of our relationships what does this look like over and over throughout what we see is this gospel rule this rule to live our life by that does not have our self at the center in to order to enact Fair it doesn't have our goodness at the center just to try to white-knuckle our way to try to figuring out how to be the manufacturer of Grace but over and over it gives us the source","30":"everything about me fact it changed everything so significantly better preach the sermon so you might have heard this the sermon series was called God affects how me and affects you and me and threw that I probably grew more as a Christian than anything that I've ever preached before I was preaching this every week going back to the scriptures and just just like just growing it in my whole view of how I live in relationships was changed by these things you see there's three different rules that really we live by it and we begin to think about what are the rules that dictate the","1":"hey guys my name is Keith and I'm excited to be here I'm Lee Pastor here resonate church and throughout the summer I don't get as many times to preach and so I really

getting","47":"if it is by you will have an endless supply if your orientation towards other people is how God was oriented to you this is key you will not be able to have a hell the ongoing non bitter marriage if you don't get this you will not be able to have a healthy ongoing Community Building friendship if you get this you will either be dominating force or you will be a doormat in both

and that's kind of how the world has existed for for many years and","50":"starts officiants in Ephesians 4:1 it says this as a prisoner for the Lord then I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received so you have to understand the calling the that you've received how Christ has live towards us and called us to be these people so it lets go back because I of juice so you must love one another so then let's see what is this look like so then here's the reaction towards that so that was the vertical thing with the way that God has called us the horizontal thing that we are to be completely humble and","77":"you're forgiven you're accepted so you can accept something that judgmental person because I was and you realize you've been in accepted you understand what that means you have been served and so you stop being stingy with serving other people you've been encouraged and so your source of income Jesus submitted and soon following Jesus's model than all of us and what we begin to do we say you know what it is easy for me to have humility among other","40":"the of this relationship and even marriages it seems like everything's hunky-dory seems like everything is fine but internally there's a lot of angst in a relationship why because they're living towards each other the way they should be living towards each other not the way they actually feel about each other and so functionally that may look okay but it's really kind of rotting from the inside out and that's found myself on the outside trying to live towards people the way I wanted to but in the inside I would be having these this bitterness this root of bitterness","80":"this is just incredible I have to live with everyone else and people who come to you to Christ in and have the world kind of shifted to that often what we begin to see is the way that they live towards their world is so powerful did the people around them that did all the sudden people are coming to Christ around them you know they're only a few days old a few weeks old a few months old a few years old in terms of following Christ and yet there's these people who have been Christians for a long time and their friends don't know they believe their friends don't have this this understanding of really what","82":"that God has lived in this incredibly gracefield way towards us and yet we hold that close it has not rocked our world that doesn't continue to say I don't deserve this that Jesus on a cross bleeding my behalf for my sense as somehow just become passe the scandal of an innocent man dying on my behalf has somehow been something that I can say about and while I'm singing songs to God I can think about what I am going to do with the rest of my day","7":"start off with what year was Albert

begin to see in this something else we begin to see a new command that I give you love one another and here is the rule here's the you have to understand this as I have loved you that changes everything not love another because you would want to be loved but all of a sudden when we begin to see the gospel here's the gospel rule the gospel is do unto others Christ","60":"we will begin the process this this is the only thing that keeps me sane this is the only thing that keeps me coming back to relationships is because of these kind of things let's go let's go on forgiveness in Romans 15:7 does this accept one another than just as Christ accepted you in order to bring praise to God it's not just about forgiveness you see this rule applies to every part of life except we live towards people this is the gospel rule this is out this changes from just being a good moral person a good religious","34":"called the Rule and the golden rule is this just kind of this religious format do unto others as you would have them do unto you and it's kind of the look in the mirror what you do to dim is how you should or what they have done to you is how you should do back to them treat them as you would want to be treated and this is what the Old Testament tells us in terms of what we should live in terms of relationships towards each other how we should live towards each other's to look and say what I want someone to do to me and this is really significant this is a completely different change right when it comes to the","75":"clean you are completely accepted before got because we can't be Distributors of something that is never been poured into I am at you know it may be safe it's hard for me to accept people are you acceptable do you feel like you have been

to be people who live in the economy of it's not the economy of Ernie because if you feel like you've earned it towards God you will make everyone else around you earn it as well that doesn't pull

and also","3":"and so kind of our and go as we do this at tonight what we're doing is we're getting into a true that is transformed my life and and this truth that I want to talk to you about only be properly Illustrated in a in a format that will require it basically a game show to happen here on stage and so this quite possibly could be the worst idea we've ever had in the history of resonate church but in our creative meeting this is all we came up with so we're going to go with it today and so so going to do is we're going to have a little bit of a a trivia show","61":"from just a good moral person a good religious person to being a gospel organ person that we often here's the rule that we often live by I will accept you if you are acceptable and if you were acceptable in and whatever your list of things that makes acceptable or not acceptable we have all kind of have different things maybe they believe in this thing or maybe they dress in this way or maybe they're funny or they're not funny or maybe they do this or that maybe to do whatever is that makes someone acceptable or unacceptable in your mind here's the thing you have been accepted unconditionally accepted we talked about this over","79":"towards you by Christ you're holding back the grace that has been given to you you're holding back at one point I thought it's impossible to do this once you understand and you've been in awe of how is Laporte you is impossible for you not to distribute that out but when I come to see is people when they begin to have that first encounter with Jesus It Blow they're mine and they're like this is just incredible I have to live with everyone else and people","38":"the Rule just wasn't enough where someone has hurt you and you and you think I should think what should I do in return that is in a way how I would want to be treated and yet for our hearts it's still leads us to place where there is it kind of a divide what were what they deserve the only thing that allows is not to give them back to what they deserve is art Zar to be a good person that's called religious it is interesting I want to be a good person","71":"if we can't say I I can't do that key that that that just doesn't work I'm not seeing that manifested in my relationships with other people it might be because there was never something it was communicated to you it means it's somehow you're trying on your own but you're trying to explain something that you don't fully understand if you've ever done that it is easy to be foolish think about all these moments where people are talking to me about their phds a dissertation and I feel like I feel like everytime I hear someone's thesis I'm like I understood two words of that no matter what it is","36":"this Golden Rule go to this religious View and this says this that I want to live better to you I want to live however to be treated in that sounds great there's a lot of good things there's a lot of society that would benefit for us to say I'm not just going to treat you as the way that you deserve retreated or the way that you treated me I'm going to treat you in a way that I would want you to treat me and so hopefully that elevates our society in terms of our in correction within our relationships that we begin to live each other live towards each other the way that we would want to be treated","48":"life the lens through we see the world and it transforms everything over and over when we begin to look through this we begin to find our self wedged into this rule in a beautiful way so what I want to do is I want to walk through scripture with you just like I did I went through into where's the one another's because I have got to figure how to live in relationships with people better I've got to understand how this tension gives goes away how this bitterness is eliminated because it's making me withdraw from people it's not allowing me to have the essence and the beauty of","76":"and I and I'm saying this as like I just can't get to this place where I can just my heart is is in a place to forgive this person who is wrong to me am I meant or the chief you've got to forgive them I said I just can't do it I can't put myself back in that place and I'm not talking about trusting them Zurn forgiveness is given you must give forgiveness because you've been forgiven that moment became really clear to me you're forgiven you're accepted","12":"Bob that's exactly what I would have said so actually it is 11 meters per second or 24 miles per hour in a very tough tough

them they kind of have pulled this back in and ended the passion thing forgot it the amazement that they have is his grace has somehow Wayne and for some of us I think that there has been this moment that the crazy thing that it is scandalous Grace has been given to us has become normalized and it's going to become normalized it becomes ignored we understand that God has lived in this incredibly","16":"when we don't that it becomes really obvious to us we kind of sniff out things that are not we are great at people that think how things should be right or things are should be wrong in terms of how they relate to each other but the issue is that when we begin to live our life 1 begin to see is that that doesn't always transpired the way that we think it should and we begin to see this idea of what is fair and what is not it begins to get really strange really fast specifically when it comes to relationships when it comes to us interacting with other people the things that we think are fair in the things that other people think are fair","62":"have accepted unconditionally accepted we talked about this over and over and resonate search for your identity become as one who is accepted regardless of what you do right this is not because you've come up to the certain level of goodness on your own you are tempted because God has accepted you there for what happens is we now accept other people because we were accepted not because they are acceptable and when we begin to live this out again these are the eye-opening think they're the rest of the verse in 13:34 of John
