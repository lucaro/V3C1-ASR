It's basically dropped right off because Tom's here and and importing less dirty energy","46":"that why is and wind farms it is one example of many so it's been a very big success story here until the slide in slide so I have this slideshow is where","85":"I get lifted up there but I detangle sorry the listed on top of the towels and then the right has a lifted","170":"walk to the Mets bias in my mind site is it something about the way that Engineers","25":"be aware when using win for a long time logical pageant righteousness is is called of the newest manifestation of that but it's just continuing something that we've been doing for a time now can you just go back for some about younger listeners watches for a lot what is that the drives a little lamb","42":"boarding energy","181":"field they working in","58":"all these things we sake planning and environmental approvals from the state oil count will local governments then when you guys had The Green Connection electronet transmission company today in connect to the grid and then the guy shot top-edged agreements to sell the power to a retailer the table apply contracts and then bites me build up and then I turn off right at 9 sign up for 25 years in the future that's in a nutshell","193":"a coil building community and I really say that with climate change coming it's going to be voicing upon us and yeah there is a lot of suffering coming actually because I mean dealing with climate change is not around side do the planets going to be here regardless it sits around","59":"in a nutshell but it is quite a skill in doing that always things well and go to water projects call kitchen set","8":"zero emissions is it about wind energy but it's actually about the wire that we harness and use energy in general cuz really there's a big picture on here and that's about the way that we harness Angie obviously modern civilization has been made possible through abundant and cheap energy in the industrial revolution particularly","199":"igneous don't have to be and so it does not have to be this propellerheads I can be yeah there's a really important role to communicate and to the Duelist off stuff as well as the hot sauce Mont my career is a testament to that and you have people who want my / the hard cordless of Science and Engineering that's okay there's still plenty of stuff to do.","185":"control things and they're all sorts of different Technologies and websites and support groups and and unlocked DPS of knowledge sharing and it's really turning to a Grassroots movement where people can actually play with scientific things by with engineering things that control things and do do what","20":"in sources including wind","194":"not around side do the planets going to be here regardless it sits around preserving yeah that the ecosystems in the climate that that we currently Drive-In and the if as it gets warmer Emily Frost it's going to be hot at the start of Thrive and survive the same way that we are now. and I really think that rather than adopting a bunker mentality and just now getting a gun and mobilize and build resilience","52":"Then you typically in the guy shot with the l'andana to have access to the land to explore and and then into a legal agreement to really quantify whether there's enough we need to build a pro then gradually","18":"worth of ask your loan and investment","69":"folding and essentially it relies on a big massive concrete this is from Mount Gambier at sorry Sandy the next slide shows a different","219":"it can be very exciting and very people-focused as well as being technical most important","223":"even if a student who's driving down there on the weekends down there with your family you can stand down look at the tip lines read about each of them at the base there and I think it's a it's a really interesting project to get involved with as well as jump onto the database and actually use that sounds. A time to some of your writing research questions okay I think that wraps up for today","166":"about food water as well so the why we produce and transport food is highly oil intensive so I'm passionate about permaculture and why is it can food cause I'm really excited by all aspects of sustainability so huge to be applied active role in a fried in the future for me I","187":"control things and do do what scientist name is due and it's it's a it's a it's a tinkering exploratory in a curiosity land process wherein yeah when I was a kid what do the arguably I think about these days is going to be easier and easier and I think that's what some science teachers should be really encouraging is is program that I had to get involved with making things in and trying things out and and saying with us","35":"a fairly small number significantly so if we jump to another slide now","83":"and then you can sit at the writer again and then by Stephen the cell which","64":"obviously that yeah that the weather there is there income year-to-year but with winter bonds that depend on that then lays them give them Judy's to investing in the farm to invest in that house that family and it's just it's wonderful to see the results of that three","220":"most important okay well I think we'll wrap up for today so I'd like to","145":"so he storage or with","45":"being a big success I have to add me I myself haven't been thinking of South Estrella in that way","86":"the listed on top of the towels and then the right has a lifted","67":"and something that I guess not many other people see it","126":"in some places absolutely smokes","206":"up on that idea of being involved getting people involved getting the community involved to make a project work and I guess that's why cool things that is happening outside at West Beach which is just outside of the Adelaide CBD there's an article in the winter","32":"I really in 1993 common language is a horizontal axis three bladed wind turbine up wind wind turbine had become dominant and it just Pisces Kyle to become bigger indigo so that just gives you a bit of an idea of the office of the development of our wind turbines","190":"sorry anything else about she will career that you would like to tell us did you study yourself in Adelaide from school for a","82":"Ross I left it off the backs of trucks and then

it stops done well it can really result in very positive benefits for individuals who have wind turbines and the communities in which they located not seen that first time last night it was my town and that really motivates me as a as a developer because Secrets jobs at the money flies down to communities","36":"significantly so if we jump to another slide now","98":"so terms of wanting to provide opportunities for stem careers science a technology engineering and Mathematics these wind farms I just thought of a one-stop-shop in terms of providing to read an old lady is","174":"basically we put a team together and got sponsorship and enhance the car to drive around the world a similar price as where you know if you have an engineering mind","161":"but 20 is

a student to take care of those photographs the foundations of the turbines and so on and I think what I'd also like to add you to swell is if you are in a lighter in South Estrella by any chance put

advantages that go with us set me up an","23":"humans have been using wind for an awfully long time I think it in your nights I think it's nice that the Persians were using at the thousands of years ago obviously we've been used in Europe windmills were used as milk the grind grind that's where the name came from obviously in Australia we've been using it to pump water from even to generate electricity even","27":"slideshows the evolution of modern wind turbines and really that the story of modern wind turbines began in the 1970s oil shock in the early 70s where the price of oil went through the roof and Bicycle World realize that we need to become less reliant on on on oil side they were number of government-sponsored programs that you had playing around with different types of
