have to be really messed up and Steve born again","52":"until eventually not saying anything in Jesus is talking all the way to the end of this is dialogue and I until Jesus ready to teach him but what would he communicates is while Nicodemus says I want to teach you I want to learn more at he saying Nick wanted Nicodemus Nikki did he wanted knowledge in Jesus saying and I know you need a new

and I will try to feel the size put out of Steelers and so is we look at Nicodemus there's three things that I want us to take away from this interaction that that Jesus has with him this morning and

it is like they're these Hypocrites again that the week people who couldn't hold it together they needed some kind of Crush in their life to help them get out of the mess they made themselves they

out there and capturing you know the stories a brief trial is not really a trial of the accused him bring it before Pontius Pilate and bring for the Roman government they needed the okay to have him

he says teacher Rabbi which means teacher tell us we seen you done some good stuff and it's interesting the way that the dialogue happens it's almost as if Jesus interrupts him so he comes home and Rabbi we know that you are a teacher who is come from God for no","77":"one of those sermons that that we preach it resonates sometimes we want people to come to Christ for the first time and some of

mother whose blood is spilled like my all of my kids were born by C-section is a lot of blood involved in that operation and remember it's it's really red then there Anna in the same way Jesus is the
