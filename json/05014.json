conversation but once you have them in your head you'll start finding opportunities to get get them out of the way everywhere any have a drink on your head in like you go to Industry meetups in Sudley pool we had like 3 hours of like rapid fire customer development like it's not about it being a formal thing","92":"and it trivializes think that the task of getting the right people the room for you to ask them questions so I'm such a believer in hosting beat up when you organize a meet up even if it's an industry you have zero credibility in just the fact that you invited everyone like all that guy knows what he's talking about you become the instant connector and then you can ask everyone questions it's like it's the easiest in personally email your first thousand","53":"you're giving them in impossible challenge just going to burn through burn through money","72":"most startup and sales take and it's impossible to give honest back in that situation it is impossible to receive on his feedback if you're the founder even if you're like Stone Cold you like come in there you like eating a raw onion you like drinking a glass of boiling water you like I can take it like give me your honest feedback like it's still like a very weird experience you need to kind of benevolence sociopath to give you honest feedback in that result they want you to be accessible but they don't care
